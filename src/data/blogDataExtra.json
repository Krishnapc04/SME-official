        "question": "Hello! My name is Omkar Prajapati. Today we have with us a Production Engineering Intern at Johnson & Johnson, who will share her journey through the CDC process, the internship experience, and tips for aspirants. Welcome! Can you briefly introduce your current role?",
        "answer": "Hi! I’m Aarya Joshi, a final-year undergraduate student. I’m currently working as a summer intern at Johnson & Johnson under the role of Production Engineering. My work primarily revolves around process improvement and real-time production optimization."
      },
      {
        "question": "Great! Let’s go back a bit — how was your CDC experience, particularly in terms of online assessments and interviews?",
        "answer": "Sure! So I actually got into Johnson & Johnson through a competition on Unstop — it was open for some IITs and NITs. I participated casually towards the end of May and cleared both rounds. Later, I was invited for a Pre-Placement Interview (PPI) even while regular classes were going on. The questions revolved mostly around the projects I had mentioned in my CV and some from core subjects. Luckily, I got selected. This wasn’t a typical off-campus opportunity — it was in collaboration with CDC. The company also came for on-campus hiring, and two of my co-interns were selected through a one-round OA when it opened officially."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you remember any specific questions from your interview?",
        "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Most of the discussion was based on my hardware project involving microcontrollers. Since my interviewer was an electrical engineer, he went into technical details like: What voltage ranges the system could handle? What problems I encountered during fluctuations? How I resolved those challenges? I didn’t expect that level of depth, but I was well-prepared since I had actually done the project myself. So my suggestion is — don’t put anything on your CV that you haven’t worked on firsthand. They also asked about my core subjects — which ones I liked or disliked and why. I gave technical reasons for all my preferences. The questions weren’t necessarily tough, but they were very thorough."
      },
      {
        "question": "Did you face any challenges as a student from the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering department?",
        "answer": "Yes, to some extent. There is some department bias — for example, TATA Steel didn’t open for us, even though it’s a core company. But honestly, if you’re skilled and patient, you’ll find opportunities. I wanted a core role but wasn’t sure I would get one, so I also prepared for other profiles. I even learned DSA, which I feel is important for everyone — it sharpens your problem-solving ability. Regarding CGPA, while many companies don’t have a hard cutoff, those with limited slots tend to shortlist higher CGs first. A CG above 8.3–8.5 is generally safe."
      }
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Don’t fake your CV — own your work and be ready to explain it in depth.",
      "Learn DSA, even for core or management roles — it improves your thinking and coding logic.",
      "Keep your options open — prepare for both core and non-core profiles.",
      "Maintain a strong CG — it silently helps in shortlisting even if not explicitly stated.",
      "Be confident and clear during interviews — technical depth matters more than buzzwords."

      "question": "Welcome Aryan! Could you start by introducing yourself and giving us a quick overview of your internship?",
      "answer": "Of course! I'm Aryan Kubal, a Dual Degree student in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering with a minor in Engineering Entrepreneurship. This summer, I worked as a Summer Associate at Nation with NaMo (NwN), as part of their Graduate Impact Leadership Program. Unlike conventional internships that revolve around slides and simulations, my role intersected politics, policy, and public impact. I got to work on campaign strategy, voter analytics, constituency research, and developing grassroots narratives. The unique part was the real-time relevance—we were shaping strategies for actual elections."
      },
      {
      "question": "How was your overall CDC experience?",
      "answer": "My CDC journey was definitely a rollercoaster. Despite having over eight internships, strong leadership positions, and quantifiable impact on my resume, most consulting and strategy firms didn't shortlist me due to my CGPA. That was tough to accept. But then, Nation with NaMo became my first and only shortlist—and thankfully, my final offer. Their process was comprehensive: an offline information session, an aptitude and SOP test, followed by three interviews. The interviews tested political awareness, case-solving ability, and alignment with the organization. One of the most intriguing questions I was asked was to design a political outreach strategy for my home constituency. No cookie-cutter frameworks worked here; it was all about creativity and understanding context."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did being from the MME department ever pose a challenge?",
      "answer": "Surprisingly, not really. Since I wasn’t applying for tech or quant roles, departmental bias didn’t impact my chances. While companies in FMCG or core-tech might favor circuital branches, consulting isn’t hung up on what department you’re from. What matters is how well you think, your stories, and how effectively you can connect the dots."
      },
      {
      "question": "What really mattered in the selection process—CGPA, PORs, or internships?",
      "answer": "To be honest, CGPA acts as the gateway. Unless you clear that initial filter, your profile doesn’t even get reviewed. But after that, it’s all about the depth of your CV—PORs with real impact, internships that resulted in measurable outcomes, and stories that reflect action and ownership. I always say your CV should sound like a TEDx talk in bullet points. And funnily enough, my Hall President role, which wasn’t even on my CV due to timing, ended up dominating one of my interviews. We talked about campus PR, crisis handling, and student elections—all very relevant to political consulting."
      },
      {
      "question": "When did your preparation for CDC start?",
      "answer": "For me, preparation began not with any formal plan, but from genuine curiosity about problem-solving. I believe the real prep begins when you start asking meaningful questions about the world around you. That mindset makes interviews, cases, and even aptitude tests easier. It wasn't about a crash course; it was about years of building perspective."
      },
      {
      "question": "What would you recommend to students aiming for a role like yours at NwN?",
      "answer": "For younger students, I’d say start early. Join societies, take on PORs, explore passion projects, attend policy events, talk to a diverse range of people, read a lot, debate, and grow your people skills. Develop a mindset that’s curious, clever, and street-smart. For seniors or those near CDC, ensure your CV is loaded with roles that showcase measurable impact. Read up on current affairs, especially politics, and be prepared to discuss them intelligently. Practice case studies, but also be ready to offer your opinion. Conviction matters a lot in political consulting."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did you use any specific resources during your preparation?",
      "answer": "Definitely. For consulting, I referred to IIT-B and IIM-A casebooks, Victor Cheng’s material, and platforms like PrepLounge. For political awareness, I stuck with current affairs, The Indian Express, The Print, and some YouTube deep-dives on policy and campaign strategy. These sources helped me build a well-rounded view."
      },
      {
      "question": "How did you make use of your summer breaks?",
      "answer": "I used them for live projects, internships, forming case practice groups, and reading industry reports. If consulting is your goal, summer is the time to sharpen your axe. Practice cases daily, think in 80/20 principles, and understand how strategy plays out in real-time scenarios."
      },
      {
      "question": "What, in your opinion, makes a good CV?",
      "answer": "A great CV has a combination of diverse PORs, internships with clear outcomes, initiative-driven side projects, and sharp formatting. It should be easy to read and packed with substance. Before submitting, always have a friend and a senior read it aloud. If they stumble, the recruiter will too."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did you have a backup plan?",
      "answer": "Always. I never banked solely on CDC. Before applying to NwN, I had already done internships across VC, policy, marketing, and startups. If NwN hadn’t worked out, I was ready to explore think tanks, strategic roles in startups, and fellowships. CDC is one of many paths, not the final goal."
      },
      {
      "question": "With one month left to CDC, what’s your advice to students?",
      "answer": "With 30 days in hand, focus on mock cases, daily practice with a smarter partner, tracking current events, and refining your CV stories. Consistency matters more than variety. Don’t try to chase ten new things. Just polish what you already have and present it clearly."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did you have target companies?",
      "answer": "Yes, I had target companies to align my prep. But I avoided the trap of having a 'dream' company. CDC is chaotic and unpredictable. Instead of idealizing a firm, focus on long-term goals and keep playing the strategic game."
      },
      {
      "question": "Lastly, what would you have done differently?",
      "answer": "I'd maintain a better CGPA. That’s the one regret. Your resume can sparkle, but a low CG can still be a dealbreaker, especially in consulting-heavy slots. Also, I’d prep for off-campus roles in parallel—never rely solely on CDC."
      },
      {
      "question": "Any final words for juniors?",
      "answer": "Apply anyway, even if you feel underprepared. Talk to people—buddy sessions are way more valuable than YouTube guides. Stay open to unexpected outcomes and prioritize long-term learning over short-term results. And if anyone ever needs a chat or has doubts, my DMs are always open!"
      }
      ],
    "tips": [
      "Start preparing early – ideally by the summer after your second year.",
      "Focus on key subjects like Corrosion and Welding if you are targeting core roles.",
      "Keep your CV honest and experience-focused — don’t add projects or work you haven’t actually done.",
      "Apply actively through cold emails for internships and research roles."

        "question": "How was your CDC experience? (OAs and interviews). Do you remember any questions from your interviews?",
        "answer": "As far as I remember, there was an online test containing 2 DSA questions. The questions were of easy to medium levels. After clearing that, there was only one online interview round, which tested DSA, SQL, Web Development and GitHub Basics. Interview questions covered everything, including the projects you mentioned in your CV, but they didn’t ask to code. They asked only for the logic and understanding of your concepts, as well as the use cases of Data Structures. Some of the questions: Why are Graphs used? How to implement them? What is Trie data structure? What is the difference between trie and tree? Why is Indexing in SQL required? How does it work? What is Linked List, Use case of Linked List."
        },
        {
        "question": "Did you face any problems as a MME student?",
        "answer": "CG matters. It was less in my case. So, If MME+less CG => difficulty in shortlisting. Try to keep your CG above 8, above 8.5 is far better. Even if your CG is 7+ it will take time, but don’t lose hope. Keep going."
        },
        {
        "question": "How much do PORs and Internships matter?",
        "answer": "I have 2 PORs. One is of Institute Girls’ Sports Secretary and the other one is of Comedy Clubs’. For Tech Profiles, PORs matter least. Most tech companies don’t even ask about PORs. But when they look at your CV, it always reflects your multitasking ability which is a plus point for you. So take PORs which you enjoy working for and not for the sake of writing in your CV. For Non-tech, yes it matters a lot."
        },
        {
        "question": "When did you start preparing for CDC? What was your preparation process like?",
        "answer": "I started in the winters of 2023. So 1 month in December 2023 and 3 months in Summers 2024 = 4 months. I mostly learned the concepts from Striver’s YouTube Course. It helped me a lot. And I tried Codeforces and CodeChef. But it didn’t go well, and I was unable to increase my rating to a level that I can showcase in my CV. So, also due to the limitation of time, I focused more on DSA than on competitive programming."
        },
        {
        "question": "How did you prepare for the interviews?",
        "answer": "I used to teach myself. I used to explain the concepts to myself. Thinking aloud helps. If it's possible, teaching others is even better."
        },
        {
        "question": "Is domain knowledge required?",
        "answer": "Mostly, not a necessity. But it's good to have it. Recruiters know we are college students with minimum industry or production level experience, so they don’t judge much by domain knowledge."
        },
        {
        "question": "How much DSA is required?",
        "answer": "You can skip the advanced topics like some algorithms in Graphs. But don’t ruin the most fundamental questions in interviews. Prepare like a question will be asked in the interview. Ensure that you can teach that question to someone who is a noob. If you can do that, it means you have grabbed the concept as well as you are able to make it understood to others in your own way. It will ease your retrieval path from your memory when needed."
        },
        {
        "question": "How much of CS fundamentals are required?",
        "answer": "CS fundamentals are essential. But mostly, Object-Oriented Programming is what they ask and it doesn't take more time."
        },
        {
        "question": "Could you share some resources for preparation? How should one start their preparation? How to utilize the summer break?",
        "answer": "My recommendation: Striver’s YouTube course and DSA sheet. Just start. Start your preparation. Take your time. Invest your time in thinking about the logic for the questions. Things take time. Have patience and keep going."
        },
        {
        "question": "What is a good CV in your opinion? How should one approach people for internships?",
        "answer": "A good CV includes projects that make the interviewers ask the questions you are already prepared for. It's like you are making them ask those questions. Avoid projects that are very common and very basic. Search for project ideas, try to implement and develop them. Looking for internships is tiring. Cold mailing, or through alums and seniors on LinkedIn helps."
        },
        {
        "question": "What was your backup profile?",
        "answer": "There was no such backup profile for mine. Moreover, there’s always a degree of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering I am pursuing. If I am tired of everything, I may try it as a profile too."
        },
        {
        "question": "With only a month in hand, what should one focus on? Should one have any target companies? Any extra tips you would like to share?",
        "answer": "Focus on everyday goals. Set your goals like 5 new questions daily. Try to achieve and even try to cross the targeted number of questions. Focus least on what you can’t do. You can’t bring a shortlist. Focus on preparation, understanding the concepts, being able to code them, and being able to make others understand - 3 pillars of complete understanding by your heart. Personally, I don’t have any target companies. You may or may not have. It’s up to you. It's not a necessity to have. As I mentioned above, have patience and keep going. Believe and just keep doing it. Don’t panic more. Speak up to your friends and seniors. Rant it out."

      "answer": "Sure! Hello Jitam, I’m Soham Jagtap, a 3rd year undergraduate student from Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, and I’m from Pune, Maharashtra. I’m currently working as an IoT and Software Developer at Xpert on a project called Voice Pulse. It’s basically a device that passively records conversations between shop owners and customers in exclusive brand outlets (EBOs). Using this, we try to understand customer psychology, like whether a customer made a purchase, and if not, what was the reason behind it. Our role involves building a hardware product using in-built mics and other components connected centrally to the POS device, which then sends audio data for analytics."
    },
    {
      "question": "Nice! How was your overall CDC experience, right from online assessments to the interviews?",
      "answer": "Yes. So as every student, I was giving the online assessment for all the companies that were available at that time. Initially, it was like I was not so successful. The reason behind that was that initially, I had not worked much on my DSA skills, and that was the reason I was not able to clear the online assessments. I started getting shortlisted only towards the end - my interview with Xpert happened on April 18th, very close to our exams. What worked in my favour was a first-year DIY project where I built an Arduino-powered fitness band that tracked push-ups and physical activities. So I had given much time there.  That project helped me get a CV shortlist for this IoT Developer role. There was a direct CV shortlisted at Xpert. In the interview, they asked questions related to IoT, like which components I’d use and how I’d handle noise reduction. I revised the basics just before the interview, and thankfully, it worked out."
    },
    {
      "question": "As you said, the last 1-2 months are crucial for CDC prep. What was your preparation strategy during that period?",
      "answer": "So the advice I’d give is - start with DSA early. Most companies coming for SDE or data profiles require it. Together, SDE and ML roles probably made up around 70% of the internships. I made the mistake of delaying my DSA prep, and I’d really suggest finishing at least the basics before the CDC begins. And in DSA, there is no particular need to go for CP; perfection is not needed. But you should at least get the basic concepts clear about DSA so that your online assessments are cleared. Apart from DSA, focus on interview prep. Good communication skills matter a lot - you should be able to explain what you know clearly and confidently. So, even if you don't know the answer of the solution, you should accept that, and you should say that I would get back as soon as I like as soon as I would work on the solution. It’s better than fumbling. If a person is 10 on 10 in his technical skills, but, say, 4 on 10 in his communication skills, then the interviewer perceives you as a 4 on 10 in technical skills too. Because interview is the first impression of you. Many students have good technical skills, but still can’t crack interviews because of their bad communication skills. In my case, my communication skills played a big role in cracking my first interview itself."
    },
    {
      "question": " How did you specifically prepare for your interviews?",
      "answer": "First, go through the job description properly. In my case, they had mentioned the Voice Pulse project, so I made sure to read up about it and related tech. Also, it helps to research questions asked by the same company in other colleges - you’ll find many online. Then, revise the fundamentals - theory, project details, and common HR questions like “Why this company?” or “What’s your motivation?” It’s best to have answers prepared beforehand, rather than thinking on the spot."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you give any mock interviews?",
      "answer": "I didn’t personally, but I would recommend them, especially for those who feel nervous. It familiarises you with the environment and boosts confidence, which is crucial during interviews."
    },
    {
      "question": "There’s often confusion about how much CGPA, PORs, and projects matter. What’s your take?",
      "answer": "For internships, if your CGPA is above 7.5 (sometimes even 7), you can apply to most companies. But shortlisting criteria vary. Some companies focus on CGPA, while others prioritise projects and practical experience. For my IoT role, my project mattered more than my CGPA.  But it is advised to keep a CGPA above 8, so that you have the best opportunity to get shortlisted, But it's never always just the CGPA.  I know my friends who have a CGPA of 6, but still they have cracked the interviews, and they are having internships over here. So it's not that CGPA is the only thing. So that is my take on this. And secondly, yes, the projects that you do matter a lot. Because generally in your interviews, they ask you about your projects, like what you did in your project? And how did you solve this particular problem in all? So, the questions related to your projects? Yes, they are always asked to judge how good your knowledge is about that particular topic or the field you are going to select. So projects have a very high value. Coming to PORs, it helps for consulting and product roles, where leadership and event experience are valued. But for core or software profiles, they matter less. So it depends on the role, and the job description is your biggest guide here."
    },
    {
      "question": "Many people feel core roles have limited opportunities compared to software or analytics. What would you say?",
      "answer": "That’s a big misconception. Yes, the number of core roles is fewer, but so is the competition. In software, hundreds of students compete for the same roles. In core, you’re competing with maybe just 80 from your batch. Also, stipends in core roles like at Vedanta, Reliance, and Tata are at par or sometimes even better than software roles. While metallurgy had about 5-10% core openings compared to total companies, if you perform well academically and show good projects, your chances are strong."
    },
    {
      "question": "So, now coming to our CV, that makes the first impression. What makes a good CV for a CDC internship? Like any specific pointers or things people often overlook?",
      "answer": "At IIT Kharagpur, there are specific CV guidelines you should follow, like - Avoid blank spaces - sentences should ideally span the full line, around 14–17 words.  It should completely fill your CV from left to right, Maintain consistency - if you write 3 points under one project/ achievement, keep 3 points for others too, Tailor content to the role. For software/data roles, 60% of your CV should be projects and internships. For consulting, the POR (Position of Responsibility) section can be bigger, Use model CVs for format reference. Keep it simple and readable, Quantify results (through numbers) wherever possible. For example: 'Achieved 98% accuracy using XGBoost.' Use concise, result-driven statements. IIT KGP allows you to build three CVs for different profiles. Take advantage of it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you use multiple CVs? How should someone choose if they have a similar aspiration?",
      "answer": "My primary CV was Software, Data/IoT focused. Ideally, this should have a work experience/internship, if possible. It’s particularly hard to have a project/internship on multiple profiles, but try to learn the skills required for that role. Like, if your secondary CV is for consulting or product strategy, try to work on relevant case studies and leadership experiences. The third CV can be core or finance-based, depending on your interest and skills. Most students go for software + data as their primary, consulting/product as secondary, and core as third. And if I'm not wrong, SWG also provides the rules the student should follow. So it is a must for students to go through those basic rules."
    },{
      "question": "And regarding these various profiles, should one have any target companies or target roles like “I want to go in this role/company only”, or should one stay flexible?",
      "answer": "If someone is confident in a particular technical skill, they can aim for a few preferred companies, but it ultimately depends on the online assessments and interviews. The smart approach is to be flexible while having at least one strong technical skill, be it DSA, software development, data, full-stack, or core. Since interview outcomes are unpredictable and company preferences can change, students should stay open to multiple profiles and opportunities to grab as many opportunities as possible. Build a CV that works for various roles, while aligning with personal interests. For example, if someone isn’t interested in finance, they can skip that track. The key is to stay flexible, give as many interviews as possible, and strengthen one core technical area."
    },
    {
      "question": "Okay, so say in a hypothetical situation, if you could go back to your preparation days, is there anything you would do differently or any mistake you would avoid?",
      "answer": "Okay, so particularly in my case, during my second-year summer vacation, I was unaware of the CDC timeline, like when the interviews are starting? When should I start the preparation? How seriously should I start with my preparation? So these were the things which I was not aware of, and I didn't pay much attention to them. And because of that, I didn't utilise my summer vacation much. And I think that was one of the biggest mistakes that I made. So yes, if I could go back, I’d pay more attention to the timeline, as it limited my chances in the first CDC phase. I’d advise students to first understand the process and schedule, then start preparing seriously during the summer. Around 2-3 months of focused prep is enough for online tests and interviews. That’s what I wish I’d done."
    },
    {
      "question": "So lastly, any extra tips, suggestions or lessons you'd like to share with juniors who will be sitting for the CDC this year?",
      "answer": "Yes - my biggest advice is don’t give up. Many students get disheartened seeing their friends getting offers while facing rejections themselves.Stay connected with your friends, keep applying, and prepare for off-campus too. I had even started networking for off-campus internships before I cracked my first interview. CDC isn’t the end of the road - whether you get an on-campus or off-campus internship, you’ll still learn the same things."
    },
    {
      "question": "That was genuinely helpful, Soham. Thank you so much for sharing your journey - I’m sure this will be really useful for our juniors. Appreciate you taking the time!",
      "answer": "Thank you! I'm really glad to hear that. Happy to help, and I hope it proves useful for everyone preparing for CDC. Feel free to reach out if there's anything else I can contribute!"

  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Can you briefly describe your current internship role at Bajaj?",
      "answer": "Sure! My role is Graduate Trainee Intern (GT Intern). The internship is mainly divided into two domains — Operations and R&D. I’m assigned to the R&D division, specifically working in the Material Science department. Right now, my project focuses on studying permanent magnets used in motors, particularly in EV batteries. These magnets require rare earth elements, which are mostly imported from China — about 90% of the global supply comes from there. But due to tariff wars and restrictions, it's becoming difficult to source them. My job is to research alternative materials or sources for these rare earth magnets. I read scientific research papers daily, analyze them, and extract useful information for possible alternatives that are cost-effective and can be developed within India."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there any difference between this kind of industrial research and the research done under professors in college?",
      "answer": "The core research approach is pretty similar — you study literature, conduct experiments, and analyze results. But the key difference is that company research is more application- and business-oriented. Apart from finding scientific solutions, we also focus on commercial feasibility and whether the solution can be developed indigenously. Companies have better infrastructure and advanced equipment compared to academic labs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How was your CDC selection process?",
      "answer": "The selection started with an online test, followed by a technical interview and then an HR round. The online test mainly tested mechanical engineering topics like force, torque, and basic mechanics — topics we studied in first-year common courses. There were also a few aptitude and mental ability questions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Was it difficult for Metallurgy students since the test was mechanical-oriented?",
      "answer": "Not really. If you have revised your first-year mechanical concepts and are confident in your metallurgy subjects, you can clear the test. The difficulty level wasn’t too high; it required basic preparation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you face any challenges as a Metallurgy student during CV shortlisting?",
      "answer": "For shortlisting, CGPA played a role, but not the only one. Once you crossed the cutoff (around 8+ CGPA is safe), the selection mostly depended on your performance in the test and interviews. There was no departmental bias. Mechanical and Metallurgy students had separate recruitment slots — so we weren’t directly competing with each other."
    },
    {
      "question": "How helpful were your PoRs and internships during the interviews?",
      "answer": "They were quite helpful. My PoR in COMPOSIT (Metallurgy Society) helped because it was relevant to my field. During interviews, they asked me what I had done apart from academics, and I could confidently mention my PoR, internships, and any projects related to metallurgy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of technical questions did they ask you in the interview?",
      "answer": "The technical questions covered our core subjects — phase transformations, grain boundaries, corrosion, mechanical behavior of materials, etc. Sometimes they would go deep into one topic and ask multiple follow-ups. They expected us to know both theoretical and practical aspects from second-year onwards."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much importance should juniors give to departmental courses?",
      "answer": "Departmental courses are very important. If you’re studying them properly during the semester, you don’t need much extra preparation. Professors like Prof. Sumantra Mondal, Prof. Karabi Das, and Prof. S. Das teach courses that build a strong foundation for both internships and placements. Good preparation during the semester itself is usually enough."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you refer to any extra resources beyond your coursework?",
      "answer": "No, I mostly stuck to our recommended textbooks and lecture notes. Our academic content itself is very comprehensive. If your basics are clear, you won’t need much additional material."
    },{
      "question": "In your opinion, what makes a strong CV for industry internships?",
      "answer": "A good CV should include: Relevant core courses aligned with industry needs, At least one good internship in the related domain, Technical projects that apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, Any relevant PoRs that show leadership or domain engagement"
    },
    {
      "question": "How important is the online test and how should students prepare for it?",
      "answer": "The online test is very important for getting shortlisted. Solving GATE Previous Year Questions (PYQs), especially from Metallurgy and Mechanical, is one of the best ways to prepare. It builds strong concepts and improves speed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you have any backup profiles other than core metallurgy?",
      "answer": "Yes, I was preparing for Data and Finance profiles as well. My priority was actually Data first, Core second. Data needed more dedicated effort — coding, courses, and practice — while Core preparation was mostly covered in regular semester studies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Would you advise juniors to stick to one profile or explore multiple ones?",
      "answer": "I strongly suggest exploring at least two profiles. IIT Kharagpur gives us that flexibility. Having multiple CVs ready — like Core + Data or Core + Finance — increases your chances significantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Dual Degree students have any advantage?",
      "answer": "Yes, Dual Degree students often have an edge in core domain profiles because of extra research exposure and advanced coursework. Companies value that additional experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "If someone has only one month left before the internship season, what should they focus on?",
      "answer": "Revise courses taught by Prof. Sumantra Mondal, Prof. Karabi Das, and Prof. S. Das Solve GATE PYQs, Use senior notes if you have limited time, Make sure your fundamentals are crystal clear"
    },
    {
      "question": "Finally, what would be an ideal roadmap for a first-year student aiming for core internships?",
      "answer": "Maintain CGPA above 8.5 from the start, Build strong fundamentals through active class participation and personal study, Do a research internship in 2nd year (even unpaid if necessary), Try for an industry internship by 3rd year, Use summer breaks for revision and research work, Build a CV with at least one good internship and 1–2 technical projects"
    }
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Know Your Core: Focus on key metallurgy subjects — they’re asked in depth.",
    "Solve GATE PYQs: Great for test prep and concept clarity.",
    "Build a Strong CV: Include 1 internship, 1–2 projects, and relevant PoRs.",
    "Have a Backup Profile: Data/Finance helps widen your chances."
