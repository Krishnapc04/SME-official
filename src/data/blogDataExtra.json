        "question": "Hello! My name is Omkar Prajapati. Today we have with us a Production Engineering Intern at Johnson & Johnson, who will share her journey through the CDC process, the internship experience, and tips for aspirants. Welcome! Can you briefly introduce your current role?",
        "answer": "Hi! I’m Aarya Joshi, a final-year undergraduate student. I’m currently working as a summer intern at Johnson & Johnson under the role of Production Engineering. My work primarily revolves around process improvement and real-time production optimization."
      },
      {
        "question": "Great! Let’s go back a bit — how was your CDC experience, particularly in terms of online assessments and interviews?",
        "answer": "Sure! So I actually got into Johnson & Johnson through a competition on Unstop — it was open for some IITs and NITs. I participated casually towards the end of May and cleared both rounds. Later, I was invited for a Pre-Placement Interview (PPI) even while regular classes were going on. The questions revolved mostly around the projects I had mentioned in my CV and some from core subjects. Luckily, I got selected. This wasn’t a typical off-campus opportunity — it was in collaboration with CDC. The company also came for on-campus hiring, and two of my co-interns were selected through a one-round OA when it opened officially."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you remember any specific questions from your interview?",
        "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Most of the discussion was based on my hardware project involving microcontrollers. Since my interviewer was an electrical engineer, he went into technical details like: What voltage ranges the system could handle? What problems I encountered during fluctuations? How I resolved those challenges? I didn’t expect that level of depth, but I was well-prepared since I had actually done the project myself. So my suggestion is — don’t put anything on your CV that you haven’t worked on firsthand. They also asked about my core subjects — which ones I liked or disliked and why. I gave technical reasons for all my preferences. The questions weren’t necessarily tough, but they were very thorough."
      },
      {
        "question": "Did you face any challenges as a student from the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering department?",
        "answer": "Yes, to some extent. There is some department bias — for example, TATA Steel didn’t open for us, even though it’s a core company. But honestly, if you’re skilled and patient, you’ll find opportunities. I wanted a core role but wasn’t sure I would get one, so I also prepared for other profiles. I even learned DSA, which I feel is important for everyone — it sharpens your problem-solving ability. Regarding CGPA, while many companies don’t have a hard cutoff, those with limited slots tend to shortlist higher CGs first. A CG above 8.3–8.5 is generally safe."
      }
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Don’t fake your CV — own your work and be ready to explain it in depth.",
      "Learn DSA, even for core or management roles — it improves your thinking and coding logic.",
      "Keep your options open — prepare for both core and non-core profiles.",
      "Maintain a strong CG — it silently helps in shortlisting even if not explicitly stated.",
      "Be confident and clear during interviews — technical depth matters more than buzzwords."

    "author": "Aryan kubal",
    "summary": "Aryan Kubal, a Dual Degree student in MME, shares his unique internship at Nation with NaMo, where he worked on political strategy and voter analytics. He reflects on CDC challenges, CV building, and tips for students exploring non-traditional roles like political consulting.",

    "questions": [
      {
      "question": "Welcome Aryan! Could you start by introducing yourself and giving us a quick overview of your internship?",
      "answer": "Of course! I'm Aryan Kubal, a Dual Degree student in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering with a minor in Engineering Entrepreneurship. This summer, I worked as a Summer Associate at Nation with NaMo (NwN), as part of their Graduate Impact Leadership Program. Unlike conventional internships that revolve around slides and simulations, my role intersected politics, policy, and public impact. I got to work on campaign strategy, voter analytics, constituency research, and developing grassroots narratives. The unique part was the real-time relevance—we were shaping strategies for actual elections."
      },
      {
      "question": "How was your overall CDC experience?",
      "answer": "My CDC journey was definitely a rollercoaster. Despite having over eight internships, strong leadership positions, and quantifiable impact on my resume, most consulting and strategy firms didn't shortlist me due to my CGPA. That was tough to accept. But then, Nation with NaMo became my first and only shortlist—and thankfully, my final offer. Their process was comprehensive: an offline information session, an aptitude and SOP test, followed by three interviews. The interviews tested political awareness, case-solving ability, and alignment with the organization. One of the most intriguing questions I was asked was to design a political outreach strategy for my home constituency. No cookie-cutter frameworks worked here; it was all about creativity and understanding context."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did being from the MME department ever pose a challenge?",
      "answer": "Surprisingly, not really. Since I wasn’t applying for tech or quant roles, departmental bias didn’t impact my chances. While companies in FMCG or core-tech might favor circuital branches, consulting isn’t hung up on what department you’re from. What matters is how well you think, your stories, and how effectively you can connect the dots."
      },
      {
      "question": "What really mattered in the selection process—CGPA, PORs, or internships?",
      "answer": "To be honest, CGPA acts as the gateway. Unless you clear that initial filter, your profile doesn’t even get reviewed. But after that, it’s all about the depth of your CV—PORs with real impact, internships that resulted in measurable outcomes, and stories that reflect action and ownership. I always say your CV should sound like a TEDx talk in bullet points. And funnily enough, my Hall President role, which wasn’t even on my CV due to timing, ended up dominating one of my interviews. We talked about campus PR, crisis handling, and student elections—all very relevant to political consulting."
      },
      {
      "question": "When did your preparation for CDC start?",
      "answer": "For me, preparation began not with any formal plan, but from genuine curiosity about problem-solving. I believe the real prep begins when you start asking meaningful questions about the world around you. That mindset makes interviews, cases, and even aptitude tests easier. It wasn't about a crash course; it was about years of building perspective."
      },
      {
      "question": "What would you recommend to students aiming for a role like yours at NwN?",
      "answer": "For younger students, I’d say start early. Join societies, take on PORs, explore passion projects, attend policy events, talk to a diverse range of people, read a lot, debate, and grow your people skills. Develop a mindset that’s curious, clever, and street-smart. For seniors or those near CDC, ensure your CV is loaded with roles that showcase measurable impact. Read up on current affairs, especially politics, and be prepared to discuss them intelligently. Practice case studies, but also be ready to offer your opinion. Conviction matters a lot in political consulting."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did you use any specific resources during your preparation?",
      "answer": "Definitely. For consulting, I referred to IIT-B and IIM-A casebooks, Victor Cheng’s material, and platforms like PrepLounge. For political awareness, I stuck with current affairs, The Indian Express, The Print, and some YouTube deep-dives on policy and campaign strategy. These sources helped me build a well-rounded view."
      },
      {
      "question": "How did you make use of your summer breaks?",
      "answer": "I used them for live projects, internships, forming case practice groups, and reading industry reports. If consulting is your goal, summer is the time to sharpen your axe. Practice cases daily, think in 80/20 principles, and understand how strategy plays out in real-time scenarios."
      },
      {
      "question": "What, in your opinion, makes a good CV?",
      "answer": "A great CV has a combination of diverse PORs, internships with clear outcomes, initiative-driven side projects, and sharp formatting. It should be easy to read and packed with substance. Before submitting, always have a friend and a senior read it aloud. If they stumble, the recruiter will too."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did you have a backup plan?",
      "answer": "Always. I never banked solely on CDC. Before applying to NwN, I had already done internships across VC, policy, marketing, and startups. If NwN hadn’t worked out, I was ready to explore think tanks, strategic roles in startups, and fellowships. CDC is one of many paths, not the final goal."
      },
      {
      "question": "With one month left to CDC, what’s your advice to students?",
      "answer": "With 30 days in hand, focus on mock cases, daily practice with a smarter partner, tracking current events, and refining your CV stories. Consistency matters more than variety. Don’t try to chase ten new things. Just polish what you already have and present it clearly."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did you have target companies?",
      "answer": "Yes, I had target companies to align my prep. But I avoided the trap of having a 'dream' company. CDC is chaotic and unpredictable. Instead of idealizing a firm, focus on long-term goals and keep playing the strategic game."
      },
      {
      "question": "Lastly, what would you have done differently?",
      "answer": "I'd maintain a better CGPA. That’s the one regret. Your resume can sparkle, but a low CG can still be a dealbreaker, especially in consulting-heavy slots. Also, I’d prep for off-campus roles in parallel—never rely solely on CDC."
      },
      {
      "question": "Any final words for juniors?",
      "answer": "Apply anyway, even if you feel underprepared. Talk to people—buddy sessions are way more valuable than YouTube guides. Stay open to unexpected outcomes and prioritize long-term learning over short-term results. And if anyone ever needs a chat or has doubts, my DMs are always open!"
      }
      ],
    "tips": [
      "Start preparing early – ideally by the summer after your second year.",
      "Focus on key subjects like Corrosion and Welding if you are targeting core roles.",
      "Keep your CV honest and experience-focused — don’t add projects or work you haven’t actually done.",
      "Apply actively through cold emails for internships and research roles."

        },
        {
        "question": "How was your CDC experience? (OAs and interviews). Do you remember any questions from your interviews?",
        "answer": "As far as I remember, there was an online test containing 2 DSA questions. The questions were of easy to medium levels. After clearing that, there was only one online interview round, which tested DSA, SQL, Web Development and GitHub Basics. Interview questions covered everything, including the projects you mentioned in your CV, but they didn’t ask to code. They asked only for the logic and understanding of your concepts, as well as the use cases of Data Structures. Some of the questions: Why are Graphs used? How to implement them? What is Trie data structure? What is the difference between trie and tree? Why is Indexing in SQL required? How does it work? What is Linked List, Use case of Linked List."
        },
        {
        "question": "Did you face any problems as a MME student?",
        "answer": "CG matters. It was less in my case. So, If MME+less CG => difficulty in shortlisting. Try to keep your CG above 8, above 8.5 is far better. Even if your CG is 7+ it will take time, but don’t lose hope. Keep going."
        },
        {
        "question": "How much do PORs and Internships matter?",
        "answer": "I have 2 PORs. One is of Institute Girls’ Sports Secretary and the other one is of Comedy Clubs’. For Tech Profiles, PORs matter least. Most tech companies don’t even ask about PORs. But when they look at your CV, it always reflects your multitasking ability which is a plus point for you. So take PORs which you enjoy working for and not for the sake of writing in your CV. For Non-tech, yes it matters a lot."
        },
        {
        "question": "When did you start preparing for CDC? What was your preparation process like?",
        "answer": "I started in the winters of 2023. So 1 month in December 2023 and 3 months in Summers 2024 = 4 months. I mostly learned the concepts from Striver’s YouTube Course. It helped me a lot. And I tried Codeforces and CodeChef. But it didn’t go well, and I was unable to increase my rating to a level that I can showcase in my CV. So, also due to the limitation of time, I focused more on DSA than on competitive programming."
        },
        {
        "question": "How did you prepare for the interviews?",
        "answer": "I used to teach myself. I used to explain the concepts to myself. Thinking aloud helps. If it's possible, teaching others is even better."
        },
        {
        "question": "Is domain knowledge required?",
        "answer": "Mostly, not a necessity. But it's good to have it. Recruiters know we are college students with minimum industry or production level experience, so they don’t judge much by domain knowledge."
        },
        {
        "question": "How much DSA is required?",
        "answer": "You can skip the advanced topics like some algorithms in Graphs. But don’t ruin the most fundamental questions in interviews. Prepare like a question will be asked in the interview. Ensure that you can teach that question to someone who is a noob. If you can do that, it means you have grabbed the concept as well as you are able to make it understood to others in your own way. It will ease your retrieval path from your memory when needed."
        },
        {
        "question": "How much of CS fundamentals are required?",
        "answer": "CS fundamentals are essential. But mostly, Object-Oriented Programming is what they ask and it doesn't take more time."
        },
        {
        "question": "Could you share some resources for preparation? How should one start their preparation? How to utilize the summer break?",
        "answer": "My recommendation: Striver’s YouTube course and DSA sheet. Just start. Start your preparation. Take your time. Invest your time in thinking about the logic for the questions. Things take time. Have patience and keep going."
        },
        {
        "question": "What is a good CV in your opinion? How should one approach people for internships?",
        "answer": "A good CV includes projects that make the interviewers ask the questions you are already prepared for. It's like you are making them ask those questions. Avoid projects that are very common and very basic. Search for project ideas, try to implement and develop them. Looking for internships is tiring. Cold mailing, or through alums and seniors on LinkedIn helps."
        },
        {
        "question": "What was your backup profile?",
        "answer": "There was no such backup profile for mine. Moreover, there’s always a degree of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering I am pursuing. If I am tired of everything, I may try it as a profile too."
        },
        {
        "question": "With only a month in hand, what should one focus on? Should one have any target companies? Any extra tips you would like to share?",
        "answer": "Focus on everyday goals. Set your goals like 5 new questions daily. Try to achieve and even try to cross the targeted number of questions. Focus least on what you can’t do. You can’t bring a shortlist. Focus on preparation, understanding the concepts, being able to code them, and being able to make others understand - 3 pillars of complete understanding by your heart. Personally, I don’t have any target companies. You may or may not have. It’s up to you. It's not a necessity to have. As I mentioned above, have patience and keep going. Believe and just keep doing it. Don’t panic more. Speak up to your friends and seniors. Rant it out."

        "Keep your CGPA above 8 for better shortlisting chances, especially in tech roles.",
