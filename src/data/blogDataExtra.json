        "question": "Hello! My name is Omkar Prajapati. Today we have with us a Production Engineering Intern at Johnson & Johnson, who will share her journey through the CDC process, the internship experience, and tips for aspirants. Welcome! Can you briefly introduce your current role?",
        "answer": "Hi! I’m Aarya Joshi, a final-year undergraduate student. I’m currently working as a summer intern at Johnson & Johnson under the role of Production Engineering. My work primarily revolves around process improvement and real-time production optimization."
      },
      {
        "question": "Great! Let’s go back a bit — how was your CDC experience, particularly in terms of online assessments and interviews?",
        "answer": "Sure! So I actually got into Johnson & Johnson through a competition on Unstop — it was open for some IITs and NITs. I participated casually towards the end of May and cleared both rounds. Later, I was invited for a Pre-Placement Interview (PPI) even while regular classes were going on. The questions revolved mostly around the projects I had mentioned in my CV and some from core subjects. Luckily, I got selected. This wasn’t a typical off-campus opportunity — it was in collaboration with CDC. The company also came for on-campus hiring, and two of my co-interns were selected through a one-round OA when it opened officially."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you remember any specific questions from your interview?",
        "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Most of the discussion was based on my hardware project involving microcontrollers. Since my interviewer was an electrical engineer, he went into technical details like: What voltage ranges the system could handle? What problems I encountered during fluctuations? How I resolved those challenges? I didn’t expect that level of depth, but I was well-prepared since I had actually done the project myself. So my suggestion is — don’t put anything on your CV that you haven’t worked on firsthand. They also asked about my core subjects — which ones I liked or disliked and why. I gave technical reasons for all my preferences. The questions weren’t necessarily tough, but they were very thorough."
      },
      {
        "question": "Did you face any challenges as a student from the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering department?",
        "answer": "Yes, to some extent. There is some department bias — for example, TATA Steel didn’t open for us, even though it’s a core company. But honestly, if you’re skilled and patient, you’ll find opportunities. I wanted a core role but wasn’t sure I would get one, so I also prepared for other profiles. I even learned DSA, which I feel is important for everyone — it sharpens your problem-solving ability. Regarding CGPA, while many companies don’t have a hard cutoff, those with limited slots tend to shortlist higher CGs first. A CG above 8.3–8.5 is generally safe."
      }
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Don’t fake your CV — own your work and be ready to explain it in depth.",
      "Learn DSA, even for core or management roles — it improves your thinking and coding logic.",
      "Keep your options open — prepare for both core and non-core profiles.",
      "Maintain a strong CG — it silently helps in shortlisting even if not explicitly stated.",
      "Be confident and clear during interviews — technical depth matters more than buzzwords."

      {
        "question": "Can you briefly describe your CDC experience and how the selection process went for Reliance?",
        "answer": "My CDC experience was great. For Reliance, the selection involved one Online Assessment (OA) round and one combined Technical and HR interview round. In the OA round, we were given 50 questions from core subjects and 50 aptitude questions, to be solved in a total of 2 hours. In the interview, questions were asked directly from my CV. I had mentioned a research internship and an ML project related to metallurgy, so the questions were mainly around those. Some examples included: What was the purpose of your project? What were its final results? Why did you choose this method for finding the grain size? There were also subject-specific questions from Corrosion like - Which grain is more resistant to corrosion: coarser or finer? When is a grain called coarser or finer (in terms of size)?"
      },
      {
        "question": "Did you face any challenges being from the MME department? How do CGPA, PORs, and internships matter?",
        "answer": "Yes, as an MME student, if you're targeting software companies, your CV needs to be especially strong. Different companies have different selection styles — some give weightage to the OA score, while others prefer a strong CV regardless of OA performance. In general: PORs don’t matter much for software or core roles. CGPA does play a role, especially for core companies and a few software ones. Internships are definitely beneficial — they give you practical exposure and differentiate you from others."

      "answer": "Of course! I'm Aryan Kubal, a Dual Degree student in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering with a minor in Engineering Entrepreneurship. This summer, I worked as a Summer Associate at Nation with NaMo (NwN), as part of their Graduate Impact Leadership Program. Unlike conventional internships that revolve around slides and simulations, my role intersected politics, policy, and public impact. I got to work on campaign strategy, voter analytics, constituency research, and developing grassroots narratives. The unique part was the real-time relevance—we were shaping strategies for actual elections."
      },
      {
      "question": "How was your overall CDC experience?",
      "answer": "My CDC journey was definitely a rollercoaster. Despite having over eight internships, strong leadership positions, and quantifiable impact on my resume, most consulting and strategy firms didn't shortlist me due to my CGPA. That was tough to accept. But then, Nation with NaMo became my first and only shortlist—and thankfully, my final offer. Their process was comprehensive: an offline information session, an aptitude and SOP test, followed by three interviews. The interviews tested political awareness, case-solving ability, and alignment with the organization. One of the most intriguing questions I was asked was to design a political outreach strategy for my home constituency. No cookie-cutter frameworks worked here; it was all about creativity and understanding context."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did being from the MME department ever pose a challenge?",
      "answer": "Surprisingly, not really. Since I wasn’t applying for tech or quant roles, departmental bias didn’t impact my chances. While companies in FMCG or core-tech might favor circuital branches, consulting isn’t hung up on what department you’re from. What matters is how well you think, your stories, and how effectively you can connect the dots."
      },
      {
      "question": "What really mattered in the selection process—CGPA, PORs, or internships?",
      "answer": "To be honest, CGPA acts as the gateway. Unless you clear that initial filter, your profile doesn’t even get reviewed. But after that, it’s all about the depth of your CV—PORs with real impact, internships that resulted in measurable outcomes, and stories that reflect action and ownership. I always say your CV should sound like a TEDx talk in bullet points. And funnily enough, my Hall President role, which wasn’t even on my CV due to timing, ended up dominating one of my interviews. We talked about campus PR, crisis handling, and student elections—all very relevant to political consulting."
      },
      {
      "question": "When did your preparation for CDC start?",
      "answer": "For me, preparation began not with any formal plan, but from genuine curiosity about problem-solving. I believe the real prep begins when you start asking meaningful questions about the world around you. That mindset makes interviews, cases, and even aptitude tests easier. It wasn't about a crash course; it was about years of building perspective."
      },
      {
      "question": "What would you recommend to students aiming for a role like yours at NwN?",
      "answer": "For younger students, I’d say start early. Join societies, take on PORs, explore passion projects, attend policy events, talk to a diverse range of people, read a lot, debate, and grow your people skills. Develop a mindset that’s curious, clever, and street-smart. For seniors or those near CDC, ensure your CV is loaded with roles that showcase measurable impact. Read up on current affairs, especially politics, and be prepared to discuss them intelligently. Practice case studies, but also be ready to offer your opinion. Conviction matters a lot in political consulting."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did you use any specific resources during your preparation?",
      "answer": "Definitely. For consulting, I referred to IIT-B and IIM-A casebooks, Victor Cheng’s material, and platforms like PrepLounge. For political awareness, I stuck with current affairs, The Indian Express, The Print, and some YouTube deep-dives on policy and campaign strategy. These sources helped me build a well-rounded view."
      },
      {
      "question": "How did you make use of your summer breaks?",
      "answer": "I used them for live projects, internships, forming case practice groups, and reading industry reports. If consulting is your goal, summer is the time to sharpen your axe. Practice cases daily, think in 80/20 principles, and understand how strategy plays out in real-time scenarios."
      },
      {
      "question": "What, in your opinion, makes a good CV?",
      "answer": "A great CV has a combination of diverse PORs, internships with clear outcomes, initiative-driven side projects, and sharp formatting. It should be easy to read and packed with substance. Before submitting, always have a friend and a senior read it aloud. If they stumble, the recruiter will too."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did you have a backup plan?",
      "answer": "Always. I never banked solely on CDC. Before applying to NwN, I had already done internships across VC, policy, marketing, and startups. If NwN hadn’t worked out, I was ready to explore think tanks, strategic roles in startups, and fellowships. CDC is one of many paths, not the final goal."
      },
      {
      "question": "With one month left to CDC, what’s your advice to students?",
      "answer": "With 30 days in hand, focus on mock cases, daily practice with a smarter partner, tracking current events, and refining your CV stories. Consistency matters more than variety. Don’t try to chase ten new things. Just polish what you already have and present it clearly."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did you have target companies?",
      "answer": "Yes, I had target companies to align my prep. But I avoided the trap of having a 'dream' company. CDC is chaotic and unpredictable. Instead of idealizing a firm, focus on long-term goals and keep playing the strategic game."
      },
      {
      "question": "Lastly, what would you have done differently?",
      "answer": "I'd maintain a better CGPA. That’s the one regret. Your resume can sparkle, but a low CG can still be a dealbreaker, especially in consulting-heavy slots. Also, I’d prep for off-campus roles in parallel—never rely solely on CDC."
      },
      {
      "question": "Any final words for juniors?",
      "answer": "Apply anyway, even if you feel underprepared. Talk to people—buddy sessions are way more valuable than YouTube guides. Stay open to unexpected outcomes and prioritize long-term learning over short-term results. And if anyone ever needs a chat or has doubts, my DMs are always open!"

If you can do that, it means you have grabbed the concept as well as you are able to make it understood to others in your own way. It will ease your retrieval path from your memory when needed."

        "question": "What is a good CV in your opinion? How should one approach people for internships?",
        "answer": "A good CV includes projects that make the interviewers ask the questions you are already prepared for. It's like you are making them ask those questions. Avoid projects that are very common and very basic. Search for project ideas, try to implement and develop them. Looking for internships is tiring. Cold mailing, or through alums and seniors on LinkedIn helps."

        "question": "With only a month in hand, what should one focus on? Should one have any target companies? Any extra tips you would like to share?",
        "answer": "Focus on everyday goals. Set your goals like 5 new questions daily. Try to achieve and even try to cross the targeted number of questions. Focus least on what you can’t do. You can’t bring a shortlist. Focus on preparation, understanding the concepts, being able to code them, and being able to make others understand - 3 pillars of complete understanding by your heart. Personally, I don’t have any target companies. You may or may not have. It’s up to you. It's not a necessity to have. As I mentioned above, have patience and keep going. Believe and just keep doing it. Don’t panic more. Speak up to your friends and seniors. Rant it out."

    "content": "",
    "questions": [
  {
    "question": "Could you introduce yourself and describe your CDC experience?",
    "answer": "I’m a student from the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering (MME), IIT Kharagpur. I recently participated in the CDC internship process and secured a core internship. The process began early in the morning with interviews starting around 10:00 AM. There were two rounds — a technical round followed by an HR round. The technical round lasted 25–30 minutes and covered core metallurgy topics like phase transformations, heat treatment, corrosion, recrystallization, and grain growth. The HR round lasted around 15 minutes and focused on questions about strengths, weaknesses, and interest in the company."
  },
  {
    "question": "What challenges did you face as an MME student during the CDC process?",
    "answer": "One major challenge is that many companies only open for circuital branches. Additionally, companies often set CGPA cutoffs (7.5 or 8.0), making it crucial to maintain a good academic record. While PoRs help in consulting roles, their relevance to the applied role is important. Internships in the related field can give a significant edge. In some interviews like Bajaj, CGPA and PoRs didn’t matter much — skills and technical depth did."
  },
  {
    "question": "When did you start preparing for CDC, and what was your process like?",
    "answer": "I started with projects in relevant domains, which helped strengthen my CV. Later, I pursued a summer internship that provided real-world experience. This combination of projects and internship helped build a strong profile for CDC."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did you prepare for your interviews?",
    "answer": "I got to know about my interview just a night before. I immediately contacted seniors who had interned at Bajaj, and they shared important topics to focus on. I revised those topics thoroughly and ensured my CV was well-prepared and polished."
  },
  {
    "question": "What resources did you use for CDC preparation?",
    "answer": "I used my class notes and PDFs shared by professors. I recommend utilizing the summer break by pursuing internships or doing relevant projects. Setting up a timeline can help stay on track."
  },
  {
    "question": "What makes a good CV in your opinion?",
    "answer": "A good CV includes real-time projects, relevant coursework and skills, and internships. CGPA alone doesn’t reflect someone’s ability — even with a lower CGPA, one can perform well in interviews if they have the right skills."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can students approach companies or professors for internships?",
    "answer": "Students can reach out to startup founders on LinkedIn and share their CVs. Other platforms like Wellfound and Glassdoor are also useful. Also, keep an eye on internship emails from the PR Chair. For research internships, cold mailing professors is a great approach."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you have a backup profile?",
    "answer": "Yes, my backup profile was Software Development (SDE)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should students focus on if only a month is left before CDC?",
    "answer": "Focus on revision rather than trying to add new projects. Identify a few target companies or profiles and tailor your preparation toward those. It’s all about focused study and consistent revision at that point."
  },
  {
    "question": "How important are departmental courses for core placements?",
    "answer": "They are extremely important. Core technical interviews are based heavily on departmental subjects. A solid grasp of these subjects is crucial."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you do any research internships or projects before CDC?",
    "answer": "Yes, I did a research internship, although it wasn’t directly relevant to the core field. So it didn’t contribute much to my CDC selection."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do dual degree students have an advantage over B.Tech students?",
    "answer": "Yes, especially in core companies. Dual degree students are often preferred over B.Tech students."
  },
  {
    "question": "Any final tips or advice you’d like to share?",
    "answer": "Don’t rush your preparation and don’t lose hope if you don’t get a shortlist early on. Keep working hard — if your preparation is good, you’ll eventually get selected either through CDC or off-campus. Luck plays a part, but consistent effort matters more. Set target companies, build a strong profile, and seek help from seniors."
  }
],
"tips": [
  "Use the summer to build solid projects or gain internship experience.",
  "Talk to seniors who interned at your target companies — their guidance is invaluable.",

      {
        "question": "Could you please introduce yourself and give us a brief about your current role at XPert?",
        "answer": "Hello Jitam, my name is Soham Jagtap. I’m a 4th year undergraduate student from Metallurgical and Materials Engineering. I'm from Pune, Maharashtra. My role at XPert is as an IoT developer. We are working on a project named Voice Pulse, which passively records the conversation between an owner and the customer in different kinds of shops and EBOs (exclusive brand outlets). Based on the recordings and transcription, we analyze the customer’s intent — whether to buy or not buy the product, and why. The goal is to understand the psychology of the customer. As an IoT developer, I work on building a hardware product with inbuilt mic and necessary components that is connected to the POS device and helps generate analytics from recordings."
      },
      {
        "question": "How was your overall CDC experience?",
        "answer": "Initially, I gave online assessments for many companies but struggled to clear them because my DSA skills were weak. That made it difficult to get shortlisted for interviews. My interview was finally held on April 18, near the end of the process and just before exams. I had done a first-year DIY project — an Arduino-powered fitness band — which helped in getting shortlisted for the IoT developer role at XPert through direct CV shortlist. In the interview, I was asked about components and noise reduction problems related to IoT development. I revised all basics before the interview and was able to clear it. Currently, the internship is ongoing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What was your preparation strategy during the last 1-2 months of the CDC?",
        "answer": "Initially, one should focus on DSA since most companies come for SDE and data roles, which require DSA for clearing online assessments. I made the mistake of not preparing DSA early, and I advise others not to repeat it. You don't need perfection or competitive programming, but strong basics are essential. After DSA, focus on interview prep. The key is good communication skills. Even if you’re technically strong, poor communication can hurt your chances. Be honest, confident, and express yourself clearly. Interviews are the first impression. I was lucky to get selected in my first interview, but communication played a major role."
      },
      {
        "question": "How did you specifically prepare for your interviews?",
        "answer": "Interview prep varies with the role. Always read the job description carefully on ERP or the company’s site — they often ask questions related to the listed project. In my case, it was Voice Pulse. I researched it well. You should also revise your basics thoroughly and research questions asked in previous interviews by the company, especially in other colleges. Sound confident, and research the company — it shows you're genuinely interested. Sometimes they ask if you've read their website. Knowing this gives you extra points. Also prepare for common HR questions like motivation, why this company, and have some questions ready to ask at the end of the interview. Don’t improvise; prepare these answers beforehand."
      },
      {
        "question": "And have you taken or given any mock interviews for that purpose? Or should someone?",
        "answer": "Yeah. So the thing is, yes, mock interviews help a lot of students. In my case, particularly, I had not given such mock interviews. But yes, it's suggested for other students to be in that environment, if at all, they feel nervous. One important thing is, students start feeling nervous during the interviews, and then they fumble in front of the recruiters. Then the answers are not up to the mark — they want to say something, but they say something completely different. These are all the problems. And if you feel that these are the problems you might also face — like if you are nervous, if you're not confident about yourself — then giving mock interviews boosts your morale a lot. So it is suggested for those students to give mock interviews earlier, and at least make yourself familiar with the environment. Because being confident during an interview — it's the most important thing that is required, as far as from my side."
      },
      {
        "question": "There’s a confusion among students about how much CGPA, PORs, and previous projects or internships matter in getting shortlisted and selected. Do you feel any one of them mattered more than the other?",
        "answer": "Yes. Speaking strictly for internships — I don’t know about the placement season — but in internships, if your CGPA is about 7.5, and sometimes even 7, you are allowed to apply to around 90% of the companies. So 7.5+ is good enough. Now, getting shortlisted varies company to company. Some companies prefer high CGPA students. Others focus more on projects — how good your projects are, how experienced you are in the field. In my case — hardware modelling and IoT — experience mattered more than CGPA. Generally, a CGPA above 8 is advisable for maximum opportunities. But CGPA is not everything — I know friends with CGPA of 6 who cracked interviews and got internships. Projects matter a lot. Interviewers often ask about your projects to judge your domain knowledge. As for PORs — for software or data roles, PORs give a slight edge only if other things are equal. But for consulting or product roles, PORs matter much more because they want people with event management or leadership experience. So yes, it depends on the field and the company. The job description is the most powerful tool — read it carefully to understand what the company wants and prepare accordingly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Many people feel core roles have limited opportunities compared to software or analytics profiles. How do you respond to that?",
        "answer": "Yeah, this is one of the greatest misconceptions students have. I think core roles have gained larger access in the last few years. I have many friends in metallurgy who got internships in core companies like Vedanta, Reliance, and Tata. The stipend in these core roles is often at par or even better than software roles. Yes, software has more opportunities, but also much more competition. Out of 1800 students in a batch, around 1200 go for software roles. Everyone is doing DSA. So even though there are more roles, competition is huge. If you’re not in the top 10-20%, it’s hard to stand out. On the other hand, core has a smaller pool — you're competing with just 80 students from your department. So less competition, and if you’re good academically and have a clear vision, chances are good. Yes, the number of core companies is lower — maybe around 5-10% of total — but the competition is proportionally lower too. Core can be a game changer if you are interested in the domain. So instead of blindly following the software path, core is a good and viable alternative."
      },
      {
        "question": "In most cases, core is one of the most under-explored profiles. Could you highlight some good opportunities in core sectors?",
        "answer": "So here it varies department to department. Speaking specifically for metallurgy — the initial job roles are mostly research-related. Honestly, I don’t have complete clarity on all core job roles. Anshuman Sahoo, one of my batchmates, got a core role in Reliance and can give a better answer. But I do know some companies that come: Amazon — they usually select one or two students from our department. Then Tata — although not this year — and Reliance and Vedanta. Vedanta took around 4-5 students, Reliance took 1-2. So these are the major recruiters I know about from the core sector for metallurgy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Now coming to our CV — it makes the first impression. So what makes a good CV for a serious internship? Any specific pointers or things people often overlook?",
        "answer": "There are many things to follow, especially for a CV in IIT Kharagpur. First, grammatical structure matters — each sentence should ideally span 14–17 words to fill the width of the page. No blank spaces. Maintain consistency — if you use three bullet points for one item, try to use three for others too. Understand what the role needs. If it's software or data-related, mention the relevant courses. For software roles, the POR section should be smaller; projects and internships should take about 60% of the space. In consulting, you can have a bigger POR section. Follow model CV formats provided — don’t try to make it fancy. It should be clean and easy to read. Include numbers wherever possible — like ‘achieved 98% accuracy using XGBoost’. Be concise and results-oriented. Lastly, in IIT Kharagpur, you can build three CVs — tailor each according to the role you are applying for."
      },{
        "question": "What was your priority order of roles/CVs?",
        "answer": "First CV should be the primary one you are best at—like SDE, Data, Finance, or Consulting. Second CV should be your backup, where if possible, you should have at least one internship. It's difficult to have internships in both, but even basic prep in the secondary CV helps. Common primary CVs are SDE, Data, or SDE+Web; common secondary CVs are Consulting, Product, or Strategy. The third CV can be Finance or Core. Follow grammatical rules and guidelines—SWG provides these. Students must read and follow those before uploading the CV on ERP."
      },
      {
        "question": "Regarding various profiles, should one have target companies/roles or be flexible?",
        "answer": "Students should be flexible but should have one strong technical skill—like DSA, web, data, full-stack, etc. While targeting specific companies can be done if you're confident in your skills, you should always be flexible because the selection process isn't predictable. Make your CV open to as many companies as possible. Don't pick areas you’re not interested in—e.g., Soham didn’t choose finance. Ask yourself key questions, and then structure your CV accordingly."
      },
      {
        "question": "If you could go back to your preparation days, is there anything you would do differently?",
        "answer": "Soham regrets not utilizing the summer vacation after 2nd year due to being unaware of timelines and seriousness. That affected his CDC Phase 1 performance. His advice is to start preparation in the summer itself—understand the full timeline and begin early. A focused 2–3 month preparation is enough to perform well in OAs and interviews."
      },
      {
        "question": "Any extra tips, suggestions, or lessons you'd like to share?",
        "answer": "Never give up. Soham got his internship at the last moment after facing many rejections. He had started applying off-campus and connecting with seniors and alums. Despite not expecting it, he gave his best in the interview and got selected. Many people around you will get selected early, and you may face rejections, but don’t lose hope. Stay connected with friends—they will motivate you. Whether it’s through CDC or off-campus, you'll learn the same things. Don't overburden yourself; many opportunities will come. Give your best but stay calm."
