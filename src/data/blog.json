      "question": "Can you briefly describe your CDC experience and how the selection process went for Reliance?",
      "answer": "My CDC experience was great. For Reliance, the selection involved one Online Assessment (OA) round and one combined Technical and HR interview round. In the OA round, we were given 50 questions from core subjects and 50 aptitude questions, to be solved in a total of 2 hours. In the interview, questions were asked directly from my CV. I had mentioned a research internship and an ML project related to metallurgy, so the questions were mainly around those. Some examples included: What was the purpose of your project? What were its final results? Why did you choose this method for finding the grain size? There were also subject-specific questions from Corrosion like - Which grain is more resistant to corrosion: coarser or finer? When is a grain called coarser or finer (in terms of size)?"
    },

      "question": "Did you face any challenges being from the MME department? How do CGPA, PORs, and internships matter?",
      "answer": "Yes, as an MME student, if you're targeting software companies, your CV needs to be especially strong. Different companies have different selection styles — some give weightage to the OA score, while others prefer a strong CV regardless of OA performance. In general: PORs don’t matter much for software or core roles. CGPA does play a role, especially for core companies and a few software ones. Internships are definitely beneficial — they give you practical exposure and differentiate you from others."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you face any challenges as a student from the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering department?",
      "answer": "Yes, to some extent. There is some department bias — for example, TATA Steel didn’t open for us, even though it’s a core company. But honestly, if you’re skilled and patient, you’ll find opportunities. I wanted a core role but wasn’t sure I would get one, so I also prepared for other profiles. I even learned DSA, which I feel is important for everyone — it sharpens your problem-solving ability. Regarding CGPA, while many companies don’t have a hard cutoff, those with limited slots tend to shortlist higher CGs first. A CG above 8.3–8.5 is generally safe."
    },
    {
      "question": "When did you start preparing and what was your approach?",

      "question": "Could you walk us through your CDC process and how you got selected?",
      "answer": "Of course. It started with a test—very simple and not technical at all. It was mostly HR-style, situation-based questions like “how would you respond to a senior in a tough situation” or “this or that” type questions. No core or technical MCQs. It was a 1-hour test, but I finished it much quicker. Based on our test performance and CV, the Vedanta Jharsuguda team shortlisted students."
      },
      {
      "question": "And how did your interview go?",
      "answer": "I had a fair idea of the process from seniors in the previous batch, so I was well prepared. The questions were mostly from extractive metallurgy. They asked which metals I was confident in—aluminium, copper, lead, zinc—and I chose aluminium. Then they asked me to walk them through the reaction sequence for aluminium extraction, which I did. They also asked about my industrial exposure, and I mentioned growing up in the UltraTech Cement colony (Aditya Birla Group). I’ve seen plant operations and furnaces up close. This led to questions on types of furnaces and their parts, and later we discussed iron and copper extraction sequences."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did they ask any HR questions?",
      "answer": "Yes, quite a few. They asked about tight deadlines, odd working hours, and whether I’d be okay working outside 9-to-5. Since I’ve seen similar environments growing up, I was very honest and confident in my answers. They also asked tricky questions like “If you had to choose between us and Aditya Birla, what would you pick and why?” I responded diplomatically and kept it balanced."
      },
      {
      "question": "When did all this take place?",

      },
      {
      "question": "Do you have any advice for future metallurgy interns?",
      "answer": "Yes—focus on extractive metallurgy. You don’t need to dive into niche topics like corrosion, transport phenomena, or steel-making unless the job role specifies it. Just have a strong grasp of surface-level concepts and explain them clearly. Impressing the interviewer matters more than covering every subject."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did you have any prior internships?",
      "answer": "Yes, and I mentioned them in the interview. I did a remote internship as a financial analyst with a biotech startup called AuroBio. I prepared investment summaries, and the company worked on microbial waste management through fermentation. This helped demonstrate that I’m genuinely interested in core and interdisciplinary work. I also did a research internship in second year at IIT Kharagpur, under the Centre of Excellence in Advanced Manufacturing Technologies, where I worked on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)."

      "question": "What about PoRs (Positions of Responsibility)?",
      "answer": "They didn’t ask much about it. But PoRs can definitely help if you don’t have strong internships or projects."
      },
      {
      "question": "How did you prepare your CV?",
      "answer": "I started about a week before the portal opened. I listed all my achievements, collected certificates, and wrote draft pointers under internships, projects, and co-curriculars. I took feedback from seniors after every draft. One useful tip: avoid overusing words like “spearheaded.” Also, be ready for formatting issues. The CDC portal glitched and changed my font size before the final submission—so always double-check."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did having those extra internships and projects help?",
      "answer": "Definitely. Having a mix of core and tech/ML projects gives you an edge. For instance, my batchmate Anushka was even asked about SVMs (Support Vector Machines) in her interview. Such things make you stand out."
      },
      {
        "question": "What was your main profile target—data, core, or something else?",

          "question": "Any general tips for building a good profile?",
          "answer": "Yes—start early. Focus on building solid sections in your CV: education, internships, projects, achievements, PoRs. If you’re missing something, create it. Watch YouTube, learn something like web dev, and build a mini project to fill the gap. Make every section meaningful."
          },

      "question": "Hi! Thank you for joining us today. To start off, could you briefly describe your current role at Vedanta?",
      "answer": "Sure! I received a CDC internship offer from Vedanta Ltd. under the VLDP GET internship—which stands for Vedanta Leadership Development Programme Graduate Engineer Trainee. This role is usually open to students from core departments like CH, MT, MI, and GG. Around 6–7 students from our department are selected every year. Though the position is fundamentally technical, interns—especially from IITs—are often entrusted with projects focused on optimization and data-driven analysis. Given my interest and experience in data, I was assigned a project involving data analysis and optimization, allowing me to apply my skills beyond conventional core work."
    },
    {
      "question": "That’s great! Can you walk us through your CDC experience—the online assessments and the interview?",
      "answer": "The selection process consisted of one online test followed by a single interview round. The test primarily included psychometric questions and some multiple-choice questions related to core topics. The interview was a mix of technical and HR questions. On the technical side, they asked about: Ferrous and non-ferrous metals, Electrorefining, electrowinning, Hydrometallurgy, pyrometallurgy, and leaching They also asked me to choose a favourite subject and probed deeper into that. Extraction processes of copper and zinc were discussed too. Since my CV leaned towards a data profile, I was also asked about my technical skills, projects, and past internships. The HR part included questions like 'Why do you want to join Vedanta?' and 'What value can you bring to this role?' The entire interview lasted around 35–40 minutes and was conducted online."
    },
    {
      "question": "As a student from MME, did you face any specific challenges in terms of shortlisting?",
      "answer": "Yes, to an extent. Many companies are biased toward circuital branches, but some still open for all departments. Personally, I got 4–5 shortlists from tech companies, but Vedanta was my first core shortlist. Students from our department often have to put in more effort, but consistent hard work does pay off. While core roles may be limited, this company stands out as it specifically considers candidates from MME. Even if you're not keen on a core role, I’d still recommend applying for this position—the work is not entirely core and is a solid opportunity. A CGPA above 7.5 helps with shortlisting, and having core-related projects or research internships definitely strengthens your profile."
    },
    {
      "question": "How important are PORs and internships for this role?",
      "answer": "They do add value, especially to demonstrate involvement and past experience. But not having formal internships isn’t a major disadvantage. Self-initiated projects or research work in core areas are equally valuable and can make your application stand out."
    },
    {
      "question": "When did you begin your CDC prep? What was your approach?",
      "answer": "I started in April, focusing mainly on Data and SDE profiles, while keeping Core as a backup. I practiced: DSA, Python, ML concepts And worked on relevant projects aligned with those domains. But honestly, DSA practice should be started earlier for better grip. If you’re targeting a company like Vedanta, definitely revise core metallurgy concepts and refer to interview questions from previous years."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did you specifically prepare for the interviews?",
      "answer": "I followed a multi-step approach: Reading blogs, Taking mock interviews, Talking to seniors Also, I focused on company-specific topics that are repeatedly asked in interviews. All of this gave me confidence and clarity during the actual process."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do departmental courses matter for this role?",
      "answer": "They matter a lot. Most of the interview questions were department-specific. For MME students, topics like metal extraction are especially important, and they were heavily emphasized in my interview."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you have any prior internships or projects before CDC? How did they help?",
      "answer": "Yes, I had: One research internship, One corporate internship, And a few self-initiated projects These experiences gave my CV practical depth, helping me get shortlists. Companies often discuss past work during interviews, so these internships definitely helped in demonstrating my abilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you think Dual Degree students have an advantage in core shortlisting?",
      "answer": "Generally, yes—especially for core roles. In our department, the shortlist ratio for Vedanta was about 70% Dual:30% B.Tech, and I was the only B.Tech student to receive an offer from the company."
    },
    {
      "question": "With just one month left before CDC, what should students focus on?",
      "answer": "With a month left, I suggest: Focus on impactful projects for your target profile, Practice DSA regularly, Go through previous interview/test questions, Prepare your CV early and get it reviewed by seniors. Also, stay in touch with seniors—they offer valuable guidance. And most importantly, don’t give up. CDC is a mix of skills and luck, and it doesn’t define your worth. Stay consistent, give your best in every opportunity, and stay positive—your effort will pay off."
    }

  "tips": [
    "Start Early – Begin DSA, Python, and ML prep in advance.",
    "Build Projects – Strong projects can boost your CV even without formal internships.",

      "answer": "Thank you! Glad to be here."
    },
    {
      "question": "How was your CDC experience? Any memorable questions?",
      "answer": "Overall, it was a good experience. For Vedanta, the process began with a psychometric test followed by a technical interview. The interview questions were highly core-focused. They asked about powder metallurgy — concepts like compaction, sintering, density, green density, and also about tempering. Since Vedanta’s profile is completely core-oriented, they expected a solid understanding of such topics."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you face any challenges as an MME student in terms of CV shortlisting?",
      "answer": "Yes, many companies don’t open for metallurgy students. They often allow only circuital branches. But if you have the right skills, you can still apply to those open for us. Companies like Amazon, for example, did accept us. For consulting firms like BCG or McKinsey, CGPA becomes very important — usually above 8 or 8.5."
    },
    {
      "question": "When did you begin preparing, and what was your strategy?",
      "answer": "Preparation depends on the profile. For core roles, past coursework and projects help a lot. For consulting and data, I’d suggest beginning at least six months in advance. I initially aimed for consulting — got shortlisted by Kepler Cannon but missed the interview due to travel. Later, I shifted focus to core because of changing criteria and my background. Understanding company-specific work helps. For Vedanta, I studied aluminium production and metallurgy concepts like ductility vs strength — and how tempering can balance both."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did you prepare for the interview?",
      "answer": "I consulted seniors for common HR and technical questions. There’s a useful HR question bank of ~60 questions. For technical preparation, I revised extraction processes for iron, aluminium, zinc — especially topics relevant to Vedanta. Seniors helped me with mock interviews too."
    },
    {
      "question": "What preparation do you suggest during summer breaks?",
      "answer": "If not doing an internship, work under a department professor. Core-related projects, literature reviews, or even projects at IISc, DMRL, or DRDO are great. A decent CGPA (7.5+) is important. Reading research papers in your domain of interest and summarizing them for your CV also adds value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does a strong CV look like to you?",
      "answer": "A good CGPA (7.5+), and strong core-related projects — especially under reputed professors or institutes. For consulting, a high CGPA, achievements in Inter-IITs, or winning case study competitions matter. Relevant projects are critical for data roles."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should students approach off-campus internships?",
      "answer": "Cold emailing is key. Reach out to professors with a solid cover letter and resume. Look for openings on portals of IITs, IISc, DRDO, IOCL, etc. Many offer summer internships — stay alert. Express genuine interest in their research area."
    },
    {
      "question": "What was your backup plan?",
      "answer": "Initially, consulting was the primary focus due to my multiple PoRs. But I eventually shifted to core after shortlisting trends changed and aligned more with my academic background."
    },
    {
      "question": "With a month left before CDC, what should one focus on?",
      "answer": "Revise past coursework and projects. Be interview-ready for every project mentioned in your CV. If targeting consulting — practice guesstimates and case studies. Talk to seniors for company-specific preparation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How important are departmental courses for core roles?",
      "answer": "They matter a lot in metallurgy-based roles. For materials science, our department has fewer courses, so that can be a limitation — but opportunities still exist."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you need extra preparation for core roles?",
      "answer": "Not much. If your basics are clear and you’ve done 2–3 good core projects (even a DIY one counts), you’re set. Don’t overdo it — just focus on fundamentals and application."
    },
    {
      "question": "Any projects or research before CDC?",
      "answer": "I worked on a research project with Stanford — not core-specific, but still valuable. Also had coursework projects that I included in my CV."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do dual-degree students have an advantage?",
      "answer": "Yes, they usually do — more experience, more courses, and an extra year for research/internship exposure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Any interdisciplinary advantages?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. For data roles or finance (especially EPs), interdisciplinary knowledge helps a lot. It adds flexibility and opens up more options."

      "question": "Great! Let’s go back a bit — how was your CDC experience, particularly in terms of online assessments and interviews?",
      "answer": "Sure! So I actually got into Johnson & Johnson through a competition on Unstop — it was open for some IITs and NITs. I participated casually towards the end of May and cleared both rounds. Later, I was invited for a Pre-Placement Interview (PPI) even while regular classes were going on. The questions revolved mostly around the projects I had mentioned in my CV and some from core subjects. Luckily, I got selected. This wasn’t a typical off-campus opportunity — it was in collaboration with CDC. The company also came for on-campus hiring, and two of my co-interns were selected through a one-round OA when it opened officially."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you remember any specific questions from your interview?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Most of the discussion was based on my hardware project involving microcontrollers. Since my interviewer was an electrical engineer, he went into technical details like: What voltage ranges the system could handle? What problems I encountered during fluctuations? How I resolved those challenges? I didn’t expect that level of depth, but I was well-prepared since I had actually done the project myself. So my suggestion is — don’t put anything on your CV that you haven’t worked on firsthand. They also asked about my core subjects — which ones I liked or disliked and why. I gave technical reasons for all my preferences. The questions weren’t necessarily tough, but they were very thorough."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you face any challenges as a student from the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering department?",
      "answer": "Yes, to some extent. There is some department bias — for example, TATA Steel didn’t open for us, even though it’s a core company. But honestly, if you’re skilled and patient, you’ll find opportunities. I wanted a core role but wasn’t sure I would get one, so I also prepared for other profiles. I even learned DSA, which I feel is important for everyone — it sharpens your problem-solving ability. Regarding CGPA, while many companies don’t have a hard cutoff, those with limited slots tend to shortlist higher CGs first. A CG above 8.3–8.5 is generally safe."
    }

  "tips": [
    "Don’t fake your CV — own your work and be ready to explain it in depth.",

This summer, I worked as a Summer Associate at Nation with NaMo (NwN), as part of their Graduate Impact Leadership Program. Unlike conventional internships that revolve around slides and simulations, my role intersected politics, policy, and public impact. I got to work on campaign strategy, voter analytics, constituency research, and developing grassroots narratives. The unique part was the real-time relevance—we were shaping strategies for actual elections."
    },
    {
    "question": "How was your overall CDC experience?",
    "answer": "My CDC journey was definitely a rollercoaster. Despite having over eight internships, strong leadership positions, and quantifiable impact on my resume, most consulting and strategy firms didn't shortlist me due to my CGPA. That was tough to accept. But then, Nation with NaMo became my first and only shortlist—and thankfully, my final offer. Their process was comprehensive: an offline information session, an aptitude and SOP test, followed by three interviews. The interviews tested political awareness, case-solving ability, and alignment with the organization. One of the most intriguing questions I was asked was to design a political outreach strategy for my home constituency. No cookie-cutter frameworks worked here; it was all about creativity and understanding context."
    },
    {
    "question": "Did being from the MME department ever pose a challenge?",
    "answer": "Surprisingly, not really. Since I wasn’t applying for tech or quant roles, departmental bias didn’t impact my chances. While companies in FMCG or core-tech might favor circuital branches, consulting isn’t hung up on what department you’re from. What matters is how well you think, your stories, and how effectively you can connect the dots."
    },
    {
    "question": "What really mattered in the selection process—CGPA, PORs, or internships?",
    "answer": "To be honest, CGPA acts as the gateway. Unless you clear that initial filter, your profile doesn’t even get reviewed. But after that, it’s all about the depth of your CV—PORs with real impact, internships that resulted in measurable outcomes, and stories that reflect action and ownership. I always say your CV should sound like a TEDx talk in bullet points. And funnily enough, my Hall President role, which wasn’t even on my CV due to timing, ended up dominating one of my interviews. We talked about campus PR, crisis handling, and student elections—all very relevant to political consulting."
    },
    {
    "question": "When did your preparation for CDC start?",
    "answer": "For me, preparation began not with any formal plan, but from genuine curiosity about problem-solving. I believe the real prep begins when you start asking meaningful questions about the world around you. That mindset makes interviews, cases, and even aptitude tests easier. It wasn't about a crash course; it was about years of building perspective."
    },
    {
    "question": "What would you recommend to students aiming for a role like yours at NwN?",
    "answer": "For younger students, I’d say start early. Join societies, take on PORs, explore passion projects, attend policy events, talk to a diverse range of people, read a lot, debate, and grow your people skills. Develop a mindset that’s curious, clever, and street-smart. For seniors or those near CDC, ensure your CV is loaded with roles that showcase measurable impact. Read up on current affairs, especially politics, and be prepared to discuss them intelligently. Practice case studies, but also be ready to offer your opinion. Conviction matters a lot in political consulting."
    },
    {
    "question": "Did you use any specific resources during your preparation?",
    "answer": "Definitely. For consulting, I referred to IIT-B and IIM-A casebooks, Victor Cheng’s material, and platforms like PrepLounge. For political awareness, I stuck with current affairs, The Indian Express, The Print, and some YouTube deep-dives on policy and campaign strategy. These sources helped me build a well-rounded view."
    },
    {
    "question": "How did you make use of your summer breaks?",
    "answer": "I used them for live projects, internships, forming case practice groups, and reading industry reports. If consulting is your goal, summer is the time to sharpen your axe. Practice cases daily, think in 80/20 principles, and understand how strategy plays out in real-time scenarios."
    },
    {
    "question": "What, in your opinion, makes a good CV?",
    "answer": "A great CV has a combination of diverse PORs, internships with clear outcomes, initiative-driven side projects, and sharp formatting. It should be easy to read and packed with substance. Before submitting, always have a friend and a senior read it aloud. If they stumble, the recruiter will too."
    },
    {
    "question": "Did you have a backup plan?",
    "answer": "Always. I never banked solely on CDC. Before applying to NwN, I had already done internships across VC, policy, marketing, and startups. If NwN hadn’t worked out, I was ready to explore think tanks, strategic roles in startups, and fellowships. CDC is one of many paths, not the final goal."
    },

    "question": "With one month left to CDC, what’s your advice to students?",
    "answer": "With 30 days in hand, focus on mock cases, daily practice with a smarter partner, tracking current events, and refining your CV stories. Consistency matters more than variety. Don’t try to chase ten new things. Just polish what you already have and present it clearly."
    },
    {
    "question": "Did you have target companies?",
    "answer": "Yes, I had target companies to align my prep. But I avoided the trap of having a 'dream' company. CDC is chaotic and unpredictable. Instead of idealizing a firm, focus on long-term goals and keep playing the strategic game."
    },
    {
    "question": "Lastly, what would you have done differently?",
    "answer": "I'd maintain a better CGPA. That’s the one regret. Your resume can sparkle, but a low CG can still be a dealbreaker, especially in consulting-heavy slots. Also, I’d prep for off-campus roles in parallel—never rely solely on CDC."
    },

    "question": "Any final words for juniors?",
    "answer": "Apply anyway, even if you feel underprepared. Talk to people—buddy sessions are way more valuable than YouTube guides. Stay open to unexpected outcomes and prioritize long-term learning over short-term results. And if anyone ever needs a chat or has doubts, my DMs are always open!"

      "answer": "I started in the winters of 2023. So 1 month in December 2023 and 3 months in Summers 2024 = 4 months. I mostly learned the concepts from Striver’s YouTube Course. It helped me a lot. And I tried Codeforces and CodeChef. But it didn’t go well, and I was unable to increase my rating to a level that I can showcase in my CV. So, also due to the limitation of time, I focused more on DSA than on competitive programming."
      },
      {
      "question": "How did you prepare for the interviews?",
      "answer": "I used to teach myself. I used to explain the concepts to myself. Thinking aloud helps. If it's possible, teaching others is even better."
      },
      {
      "question": "Is domain knowledge required?",
      "answer": "Mostly, not a necessity. But it's good to have it. Recruiters know we are college students with minimum industry or production level experience, so they don’t judge much by domain knowledge."
      },
      {
      "question": "How much DSA is required?",
      "answer": "You can skip the advanced topics like some algorithms in Graphs. But don’t ruin the most fundamental questions in interviews. Prepare like a question will be asked in the interview. Ensure that you can teach that question to someone who is a noob. If you can do that, it means you have grabbed the concept as well as you are able to make it understood to others in your own way. It will ease your retrieval path from your memory when needed."
      },
      {
      "question": "How much of CS fundamentals are required?",
      "answer": "CS fundamentals are essential. But mostly, Object-Oriented Programming is what they ask and it doesn't take more time."
      },
      {
      "question": "Could you share some resources for preparation? How should one start their preparation? How to utilize the summer break?",
      "answer": "My recommendation: Striver’s YouTube course and DSA sheet. Just start. Start your preparation. Take your time. Invest your time in thinking about the logic for the questions. Things take time. Have patience and keep going."
      },
      {
      "question": "What is a good CV in your opinion? How should one approach people for internships?",
      "answer": "A good CV includes projects that make the interviewers ask the questions you are already prepared for. It's like you are making them ask those questions. Avoid projects that are very common and very basic. Search for project ideas, try to implement and develop them. Looking for internships is tiring. Cold mailing, or through alums and seniors on LinkedIn helps."
      },
      {
      "question": "What was your backup profile?",
      "answer": "There was no such backup profile for mine. Moreover, there’s always a degree of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering I am pursuing. If I am tired of everything, I may try it as a profile too."
      },
      {
      "question": "With only a month in hand, what should one focus on? Should one have any target companies? Any extra tips you would like to share?",
      "answer": "Focus on everyday goals. Set your goals like 5 new questions daily. Try to achieve and even try to cross the targeted number of questions. Focus least on what you can’t do. You can’t bring a shortlist. Focus on preparation, understanding the concepts, being able to code them, and being able to make others understand - 3 pillars of complete understanding by your heart. Personally, I don’t have any target companies. You may or may not have. It’s up to you. It's not a necessity to have. As I mentioned above, have patience and keep going. Believe and just keep doing it. Don’t panic more. Speak up to your friends and seniors. Rant it out."

  {
    "question": "Hello, Soham, this is Jitam Barman, Head at COMPOSIT. First of all, congratulations on securing an internship at Xpert! To begin with, could you please introduce yourself and give us a brief about your current role there?",
    "answer": "Sure! Hello Jitam, I’m Soham Jagtap, a 3rd year undergraduate student from Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, and I’m from Pune, Maharashtra. I’m currently working as an IoT and Software Developer at Xpert on a project called Voice Pulse. It’s basically a device that passively records conversations between shop owners and customers in exclusive brand outlets (EBOs). Using this, we try to understand customer psychology, like whether a customer made a purchase, and if not, what was the reason behind it. Our role involves building a hardware product using in-built mics and other components connected centrally to the POS device, which then sends audio data for analytics."
  },
  {
    "question": "Nice! How was your overall CDC experience, right from online assessments to the interviews?",
    "answer": "Yes. So as every student, I was giving the online assessment for all the companies that were available at that time. Initially, it was like I was not so successful. The reason behind that was that initially, I had not worked much on my DSA skills, and that was the reason I was not able to clear the online assessments. I started getting shortlisted only towards the end - my interview with Xpert happened on April 18th, very close to our exams. What worked in my favour was a first-year DIY project where I built an Arduino-powered fitness band that tracked push-ups and physical activities. So I had given much time there.  That project helped me get a CV shortlist for this IoT Developer role. There was a direct CV shortlisted at Xpert. In the interview, they asked questions related to IoT, like which components I’d use and how I’d handle noise reduction. I revised the basics just before the interview, and thankfully, it worked out."
  },
  {
    "question": "As you said, the last 1-2 months are crucial for CDC prep. What was your preparation strategy during that period?",
    "answer": "So the advice I’d give is - start with DSA early. Most companies coming for SDE or data profiles require it. Together, SDE and ML roles probably made up around 70% of the internships. I made the mistake of delaying my DSA prep, and I’d really suggest finishing at least the basics before the CDC begins. And in DSA, there is no particular need to go for CP; perfection is not needed. But you should at least get the basic concepts clear about DSA so that your online assessments are cleared. Apart from DSA, focus on interview prep. Good communication skills matter a lot - you should be able to explain what you know clearly and confidently. So, even if you don't know the answer of the solution, you should accept that, and you should say that I would get back as soon as I like as soon as I would work on the solution. It’s better than fumbling. If a person is 10 on 10 in his technical skills, but, say, 4 on 10 in his communication skills, then the interviewer perceives you as a 4 on 10 in technical skills too. Because interview is the first impression of you. Many students have good technical skills, but still can’t crack interviews because of their bad communication skills. In my case, my communication skills played a big role in cracking my first interview itself."
  },
  {
    "question": " How did you specifically prepare for your interviews?",
    "answer": "First, go through the job description properly. In my case, they had mentioned the Voice Pulse project, so I made sure to read up about it and related tech. Also, it helps to research questions asked by the same company in other colleges - you’ll find many online. Then, revise the fundamentals - theory, project details, and common HR questions like “Why this company?” or “What’s your motivation?” It’s best to have answers prepared beforehand, rather than thinking on the spot."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you give any mock interviews?",
    "answer": "I didn’t personally, but I would recommend them, especially for those who feel nervous. It familiarises you with the environment and boosts confidence, which is crucial during interviews."
  },
  {
    "question": "There’s often confusion about how much CGPA, PORs, and projects matter. What’s your take?",
    "answer": "For internships, if your CGPA is above 7.5 (sometimes even 7), you can apply to most companies. But shortlisting criteria vary. Some companies focus on CGPA, while others prioritise projects and practical experience. For my IoT role, my project mattered more than my CGPA.  But it is advised to keep a CGPA above 8, so that you have the best opportunity to get shortlisted, But it's never always just the CGPA.  I know my friends who have a CGPA of 6, but still they have cracked the interviews, and they are having internships over here. So it's not that CGPA is the only thing. So that is my take on this. And secondly, yes, the projects that you do matter a lot. Because generally in your interviews, they ask you about your projects, like what you did in your project? And how did you solve this particular problem in all? So, the questions related to your projects? Yes, they are always asked to judge how good your knowledge is about that particular topic or the field you are going to select. So projects have a very high value. Coming to PORs, it helps for consulting and product roles, where leadership and event experience are valued. But for core or software profiles, they matter less. So it depends on the role, and the job description is your biggest guide here."
  },
  {
    "question": "Many people feel core roles have limited opportunities compared to software or analytics. What would you say?",
    "answer": "That’s a big misconception. Yes, the number of core roles is fewer, but so is the competition. In software, hundreds of students compete for the same roles. In core, you’re competing with maybe just 80 from your batch. Also, stipends in core roles like at Vedanta, Reliance, and Tata are at par or sometimes even better than software roles. While metallurgy had about 5-10% core openings compared to total companies, if you perform well academically and show good projects, your chances are strong."
  },
  {
    "question": "So, now coming to our CV, that makes the first impression. What makes a good CV for a CDC internship? Like any specific pointers or things people often overlook?",
    "answer": "At IIT Kharagpur, there are specific CV guidelines you should follow, like - Avoid blank spaces - sentences should ideally span the full line, around 14–17 words.  It should completely fill your CV from left to right, Maintain consistency - if you write 3 points under one project/ achievement, keep 3 points for others too, Tailor content to the role. For software/data roles, 60% of your CV should be projects and internships. For consulting, the POR (Position of Responsibility) section can be bigger, Use model CVs for format reference. Keep it simple and readable, Quantify results (through numbers) wherever possible. For example: 'Achieved 98% accuracy using XGBoost.' Use concise, result-driven statements. IIT KGP allows you to build three CVs for different profiles. Take advantage of it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you use multiple CVs? How should someone choose if they have a similar aspiration?",
    "answer": "My primary CV was Software, Data/IoT focused. Ideally, this should have a work experience/internship, if possible. It’s particularly hard to have a project/internship on multiple profiles, but try to learn the skills required for that role. Like, if your secondary CV is for consulting or product strategy, try to work on relevant case studies and leadership experiences. The third CV can be core or finance-based, depending on your interest and skills. Most students go for software + data as their primary, consulting/product as secondary, and core as third. And if I'm not wrong, SWG also provides the rules the student should follow. So it is a must for students to go through those basic rules."
  },{
    "question": "And regarding these various profiles, should one have any target companies or target roles like “I want to go in this role/company only”, or should one stay flexible?",
    "answer": "If someone is confident in a particular technical skill, they can aim for a few preferred companies, but it ultimately depends on the online assessments and interviews. The smart approach is to be flexible while having at least one strong technical skill, be it DSA, software development, data, full-stack, or core. Since interview outcomes are unpredictable and company preferences can change, students should stay open to multiple profiles and opportunities to grab as many opportunities as possible. Build a CV that works for various roles, while aligning with personal interests. For example, if someone isn’t interested in finance, they can skip that track. The key is to stay flexible, give as many interviews as possible, and strengthen one core technical area."
  },
  {
    "question": "Okay, so say in a hypothetical situation, if you could go back to your preparation days, is there anything you would do differently or any mistake you would avoid?",
    "answer": "Okay, so particularly in my case, during my second-year summer vacation, I was unaware of the CDC timeline, like when the interviews are starting? When should I start the preparation? How seriously should I start with my preparation? So these were the things which I was not aware of, and I didn't pay much attention to them. And because of that, I didn't utilise my summer vacation much. And I think that was one of the biggest mistakes that I made. So yes, if I could go back, I’d pay more attention to the timeline, as it limited my chances in the first CDC phase. I’d advise students to first understand the process and schedule, then start preparing seriously during the summer. Around 2-3 months of focused prep is enough for online tests and interviews. That’s what I wish I’d done."
  },
  {
    "question": "So lastly, any extra tips, suggestions or lessons you'd like to share with juniors who will be sitting for the CDC this year?",
    "answer": "Yes - my biggest advice is don’t give up. Many students get disheartened seeing their friends getting offers while facing rejections themselves.Stay connected with your friends, keep applying, and prepare for off-campus too. I had even started networking for off-campus internships before I cracked my first interview. CDC isn’t the end of the road - whether you get an on-campus or off-campus internship, you’ll still learn the same things."
  },
  {
    "question": "That was genuinely helpful, Soham. Thank you so much for sharing your journey - I’m sure this will be really useful for our juniors. Appreciate you taking the time!",
    "answer": "Thank you! I'm really glad to hear that. Happy to help, and I hope it proves useful for everyone preparing for CDC. Feel free to reach out if there's anything else I can contribute!"

I’m assigned to the R&D division, specifically working in the Material Science department. Right now, my project focuses on studying permanent magnets used in motors, particularly in EV batteries. These magnets require rare earth elements, which are mostly imported from China — about 90% of the global supply comes from there. But due to tariff wars and restrictions, it's becoming difficult to source them. My job is to research alternative materials or sources for these rare earth magnets. I read scientific research papers daily, analyze them, and extract useful information for possible alternatives that are cost-effective and can be developed within India."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there any difference between this kind of industrial research and the research done under professors in college?",
    "answer": "The core research approach is pretty similar — you study literature, conduct experiments, and analyze results. But the key difference is that company research is more application- and business-oriented. Apart from finding scientific solutions, we also focus on commercial feasibility and whether the solution can be developed indigenously. Companies have better infrastructure and advanced equipment compared to academic labs."
  },
  {
    "question": "How was your CDC selection process?",
    "answer": "The selection started with an online test, followed by a technical interview and then an HR round. The online test mainly tested mechanical engineering topics like force, torque, and basic mechanics — topics we studied in first-year common courses. There were also a few aptitude and mental ability questions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Was it difficult for Metallurgy students since the test was mechanical-oriented?",
    "answer": "Not really. If you have revised your first-year mechanical concepts and are confident in your metallurgy subjects, you can clear the test. The difficulty level wasn’t too high; it required basic preparation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you face any challenges as a Metallurgy student during CV shortlisting?",
    "answer": "For shortlisting, CGPA played a role, but not the only one. Once you crossed the cutoff (around 8+ CGPA is safe), the selection mostly depended on your performance in the test and interviews. There was no departmental bias. Mechanical and Metallurgy students had separate recruitment slots — so we weren’t directly competing with each other."
  },
  {
    "question": "How helpful were your PoRs and internships during the interviews?",
    "answer": "They were quite helpful. My PoR in COMPOSIT (Metallurgy Society) helped because it was relevant to my field. During interviews, they asked me what I had done apart from academics, and I could confidently mention my PoR, internships, and any projects related to metallurgy."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of technical questions did they ask you in the interview?",
    "answer": "The technical questions covered our core subjects — phase transformations, grain boundaries, corrosion, mechanical behavior of materials, etc. Sometimes they would go deep into one topic and ask multiple follow-ups. They expected us to know both theoretical and practical aspects from second-year onwards."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much importance should juniors give to departmental courses?",
    "answer": "Departmental courses are very important. If you’re studying them properly during the semester, you don’t need much extra preparation. Professors like Prof. Sumantra Mondal, Prof. Karabi Das, and Prof. S. Das teach courses that build a strong foundation for both internships and placements. Good preparation during the semester itself is usually enough."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you refer to any extra resources beyond your coursework?",
    "answer": "No, I mostly stuck to our recommended textbooks and lecture notes. Our academic content itself is very comprehensive. If your basics are clear, you won’t need much additional material."
  },{
    "question": "In your opinion, what makes a strong CV for industry internships?",
    "answer": "A good CV should include: Relevant core courses aligned with industry needs, At least one good internship in the related domain, Technical projects that apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, Any relevant PoRs that show leadership or domain engagement"
  },
  {
    "question": "How important is the online test and how should students prepare for it?",
    "answer": "The online test is very important for getting shortlisted. Solving GATE Previous Year Questions (PYQs), especially from Metallurgy and Mechanical, is one of the best ways to prepare. It builds strong concepts and improves speed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you have any backup profiles other than core metallurgy?",
    "answer": "Yes, I was preparing for Data and Finance profiles as well. My priority was actually Data first, Core second. Data needed more dedicated effort — coding, courses, and practice — while Core preparation was mostly covered in regular semester studies."
  },
  {
    "question": "Would you advise juniors to stick to one profile or explore multiple ones?",
    "answer": "I strongly suggest exploring at least two profiles. IIT Kharagpur gives us that flexibility. Having multiple CVs ready — like Core + Data or Core + Finance — increases your chances significantly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do Dual Degree students have any advantage?",
    "answer": "Yes, Dual Degree students often have an edge in core domain profiles because of extra research exposure and advanced coursework. Companies value that additional experience."
  },
  {
    "question": "If someone has only one month left before the internship season, what should they focus on?",
    "answer": "Revise courses taught by Prof. Sumantra Mondal, Prof. Karabi Das, and Prof. S. Das Solve GATE PYQs, Use senior notes if you have limited time, Make sure your fundamentals are crystal clear"
  },
  {
    "question": "Finally, what would be an ideal roadmap for a first-year student aiming for core internships?",
    "answer": "Maintain CGPA above 8.5 from the start, Build strong fundamentals through active class participation and personal study, Do a research internship in 2nd year (even unpaid if necessary), Try for an industry internship by 3rd year, Use summer breaks for revision and research work, Build a CV with at least one good internship and 1–2 technical projects"
