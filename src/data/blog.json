            "question": "How was your CDC experience?",
            "answer": "It was quite exhausting but also a valuable experience. I found out I was shortlisted for the role around 9–10 PM the night before, and we had to report by 8:30 AM the next morning. Around 54 candidates were shortlisted initially. My first interview round took place around 12:30 PM, followed by lunch. Post that, we learned that 11 candidates were shortlisted for the second round, which began at 3:30 PM, mine happened around 6 PM. Everyone who made it to the second round also had to appear for the HR round, which happened around 7:30 PM for me. Final results were announced by 8–8:30 PM, with 4 candidates selected. The whole process stretched over 12 hours and tested both patience and stamina, but it was rewarding in the end."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do you remember any questions from your interviews?",
            "answer": "Yes, they asked a mix of questions covering Python basics, details from my CV, and quite a few ML/DL-related concepts, nothing too difficult but definitely thorough. Since I had included some finance-related experience on my CV, they asked me to use my data science knowledge to build a basic financial model to predict stock movement given some historical data. Additionally, there was a SQL question that I had to solve on the blackboard, which tested my ability to write and explain queries under pressure."
          },
          {

            "answer": "Generally, students from non-CS departments like Metallurgy do face challenges, especially with CV shortlisting due to CG cutoffs or department bias. Personally, I was fortunate to have a few focused spikes on my CV which aligned well with the roles I was targeting, so I didn’t face many issues with shortlisting. But I’m very aware that this isn't the case for many, and the department tag can often be a limiting factor despite one’s skills."
          },
          {
            "question": "How much do PORs and Internships matter?",
            "answer": "Positions of Responsibility (PORs) matter primarily if you're targeting roles like consulting, where leadership and team experience are valued. For most other roles, especially in tech or core fields, what really matters is how well you’ve prepared for what you’ve listed on your CV. Recruiters focus more on the depth and relevance of your experiences whether that’s an internship, project, or POR rather than just the title itself."
          },
          {
            "question": "When did you start preparing for CDC? What was your preparation process like?",
            "answer": "I started preparing a few months before CDC, with a major focus on programming and problem-solving. I was part of the JPMorgan Chase Quantitative Finance Mentorship, where I got exposure to concepts like object-oriented programming, core math and probability, and finance-related topics. Alongside that, I dedicated most of my time to DSA and improving my coding skills. Once I got into the flow, I maintained consistent practice and made sure I was confident about everything I had put on my CV."
          },
          {
            "question": "How did you prepare for the interviews?",
            "answer": " I started by making detailed notes on every single line of my CV, not just what I did, but why I did it, what impact it had, and what I learned. This helped me stay confident and consistent across different rounds. I also reached out to seniors and asked them to take mock interviews, which gave me a clearer understanding of what to expect and helped me improve my articulation. Additionally, I prepared a strong, well-structured introduction about myself, something that was descriptive yet concise so I could set the right tone at the start of each interview. This helped me feel more in control and made transitions into technical or project-related discussions much smoother."
          },
          {
            "question": "Domain knowledge requirements.",
            "answer": "It really depends on the role you're applying for. For technical and data-driven roles, a strong understanding of the fundamentals like Python, SQL, Machine Learning, or Statistics is important. If your CV or the role touches specific domains like finance or core engineering, then having relevant domain knowledge definitely helps. In my case, since I had exposure through the JPMorgan Quantitative Finance Mentorship, I was expected to know basics of finance, probability, and modeling. That said, interviewers usually focus more on how well you understand and can apply what you’ve written on your CV, rather than expecting deep expertise in every domain."
          }
          ,{
            "question": "How much DSA is required?",
            "answer": "DSA is very important, especially because it forms the basis of most online assessments that companies use to shortlist candidates for interviews. The difficulty level varies from company to company, some may ask basic to medium-level questions, while others might go for advanced problems. Regardless, having a good grasp of core topics like arrays, strings, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming can really make a difference in clearing the initial rounds."
          },
          {
            "question": "How much of CS fundamentals are required?",
            "answer": "For students from non-CS branches, CS fundamentals are usually not the main focus during interviews. However, certain topics like Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) are commonly asked and should be prepared well. Having a basic understanding of DBMS, Operating Systems, or Networks can help, but it’s not typically expected unless the role specifically demands it. Overall, interviewers mainly test how well you understand and can apply what’s relevant to your CV and the role."
          },
          {
            "question": "Could you share some resources for preparation? How should one start their preparation? How to utilize the summer break?",
            "answer": "For DSA, I primarily used platforms like LeetCode, InterviewBit, and GFG. For SQL, StrataScratch and Hackerrank are great. I also followed free YouTube playlists (like those by Apna College or Love Babbar) for revision. For ML and domain-specific prep, I referred to Andrew Ng’s ML course, StatQuest for concepts, and worked on small projects using Kaggle datasets."
          },
          {
            "question": "What is a good CV in your opinion?",
            "answer": "A good CV tells a clear story. It doesn’t have to be filled with ten things — even a few well-explained, high-impact projects or experiences are enough."
          },
          {
            "question": "How should one approach people for internships?",

          },
          {
            "question": "What was your backup profile?",
            "answer": "Since my primary interest was in AI and Data, my backup was applying to data analyst or product analyst roles, where coding wasn't heavily tested but problem-solving and domain understanding mattered. I had also worked on a few small-scale finance-related projects and was comfortable switching towards quant analyst roles if needed."
          },
          {
            "question": "With only a month in hand, what should one focus on? Should one have any target companies? Any extra tips you would like to share?",
            "answer": "Focusing on DSA and reviewing whatever you have done till now in depth should be ideal. I would recommend learning anything new right now, just keep getting better at what you already know."
