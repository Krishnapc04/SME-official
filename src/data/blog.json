      "question": "Can you briefly describe your CDC experience and how the selection process went for Reliance?",
      "answer": "My CDC experience was great. For Reliance, the selection involved one Online Assessment (OA) round and one combined Technical and HR interview round. In the OA round, we were given 50 questions from core subjects and 50 aptitude questions, to be solved in a total of 2 hours. In the interview, questions were asked directly from my CV. I had mentioned a research internship and an ML project related to metallurgy, so the questions were mainly around those. Some examples included: What was the purpose of your project? What were its final results? Why did you choose this method for finding the grain size? There were also subject-specific questions from Corrosion like - Which grain is more resistant to corrosion: coarser or finer? When is a grain called coarser or finer (in terms of size)?"
    },

      "question": "Did you face any challenges being from the MME department? How do CGPA, PORs, and internships matter?",
      "answer": "Yes, as an MME student, if you're targeting software companies, your CV needs to be especially strong. Different companies have different selection styles — some give weightage to the OA score, while others prefer a strong CV regardless of OA performance. In general: PORs don’t matter much for software or core roles. CGPA does play a role, especially for core companies and a few software ones. Internships are definitely beneficial — they give you practical exposure and differentiate you from others."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you face any challenges as a student from the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering department?",
      "answer": "Yes, to some extent. There is some department bias — for example, TATA Steel didn’t open for us, even though it’s a core company. But honestly, if you’re skilled and patient, you’ll find opportunities. I wanted a core role but wasn’t sure I would get one, so I also prepared for other profiles. I even learned DSA, which I feel is important for everyone — it sharpens your problem-solving ability. Regarding CGPA, while many companies don’t have a hard cutoff, those with limited slots tend to shortlist higher CGs first. A CG above 8.3–8.5 is generally safe."
    },
    {
      "question": "When did you start preparing and what was your approach?",

      "question": "Could you walk us through your CDC process and how you got selected?",
      "answer": "Of course. It started with a test—very simple and not technical at all. It was mostly HR-style, situation-based questions like “how would you respond to a senior in a tough situation” or “this or that” type questions. No core or technical MCQs. It was a 1-hour test, but I finished it much quicker. Based on our test performance and CV, the Vedanta Jharsuguda team shortlisted students."
      },
      {
      "question": "And how did your interview go?",
      "answer": "I had a fair idea of the process from seniors in the previous batch, so I was well prepared. The questions were mostly from extractive metallurgy. They asked which metals I was confident in—aluminium, copper, lead, zinc—and I chose aluminium. Then they asked me to walk them through the reaction sequence for aluminium extraction, which I did. They also asked about my industrial exposure, and I mentioned growing up in the UltraTech Cement colony (Aditya Birla Group). I’ve seen plant operations and furnaces up close. This led to questions on types of furnaces and their parts, and later we discussed iron and copper extraction sequences."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did they ask any HR questions?",
      "answer": "Yes, quite a few. They asked about tight deadlines, odd working hours, and whether I’d be okay working outside 9-to-5. Since I’ve seen similar environments growing up, I was very honest and confident in my answers. They also asked tricky questions like “If you had to choose between us and Aditya Birla, what would you pick and why?” I responded diplomatically and kept it balanced."
      },
      {
      "question": "When did all this take place?",

      },
      {
      "question": "Do you have any advice for future metallurgy interns?",
      "answer": "Yes—focus on extractive metallurgy. You don’t need to dive into niche topics like corrosion, transport phenomena, or steel-making unless the job role specifies it. Just have a strong grasp of surface-level concepts and explain them clearly. Impressing the interviewer matters more than covering every subject."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did you have any prior internships?",
      "answer": "Yes, and I mentioned them in the interview. I did a remote internship as a financial analyst with a biotech startup called AuroBio. I prepared investment summaries, and the company worked on microbial waste management through fermentation. This helped demonstrate that I’m genuinely interested in core and interdisciplinary work. I also did a research internship in second year at IIT Kharagpur, under the Centre of Excellence in Advanced Manufacturing Technologies, where I worked on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)."

      "question": "What about PoRs (Positions of Responsibility)?",
      "answer": "They didn’t ask much about it. But PoRs can definitely help if you don’t have strong internships or projects."
      },
      {
      "question": "How did you prepare your CV?",
      "answer": "I started about a week before the portal opened. I listed all my achievements, collected certificates, and wrote draft pointers under internships, projects, and co-curriculars. I took feedback from seniors after every draft. One useful tip: avoid overusing words like “spearheaded.” Also, be ready for formatting issues. The CDC portal glitched and changed my font size before the final submission—so always double-check."
      },
      {
      "question": "Did having those extra internships and projects help?",
      "answer": "Definitely. Having a mix of core and tech/ML projects gives you an edge. For instance, my batchmate Anushka was even asked about SVMs (Support Vector Machines) in her interview. Such things make you stand out."
      },
      {
        "question": "What was your main profile target—data, core, or something else?",

          "question": "Any general tips for building a good profile?",
          "answer": "Yes—start early. Focus on building solid sections in your CV: education, internships, projects, achievements, PoRs. If you’re missing something, create it. Watch YouTube, learn something like web dev, and build a mini project to fill the gap. Make every section meaningful."
          },

      "question": "Hi! Thank you for joining us today. To start off, could you briefly describe your current role at Vedanta?",
      "answer": "Sure! I received a CDC internship offer from Vedanta Ltd. under the VLDP GET internship—which stands for Vedanta Leadership Development Programme Graduate Engineer Trainee. This role is usually open to students from core departments like CH, MT, MI, and GG. Around 6–7 students from our department are selected every year. Though the position is fundamentally technical, interns—especially from IITs—are often entrusted with projects focused on optimization and data-driven analysis. Given my interest and experience in data, I was assigned a project involving data analysis and optimization, allowing me to apply my skills beyond conventional core work."
    },
    {
      "question": "That’s great! Can you walk us through your CDC experience—the online assessments and the interview?",
      "answer": "The selection process consisted of one online test followed by a single interview round. The test primarily included psychometric questions and some multiple-choice questions related to core topics. The interview was a mix of technical and HR questions. On the technical side, they asked about: Ferrous and non-ferrous metals, Electrorefining, electrowinning, Hydrometallurgy, pyrometallurgy, and leaching They also asked me to choose a favourite subject and probed deeper into that. Extraction processes of copper and zinc were discussed too. Since my CV leaned towards a data profile, I was also asked about my technical skills, projects, and past internships. The HR part included questions like 'Why do you want to join Vedanta?' and 'What value can you bring to this role?' The entire interview lasted around 35–40 minutes and was conducted online."
    },
    {
      "question": "As a student from MME, did you face any specific challenges in terms of shortlisting?",
      "answer": "Yes, to an extent. Many companies are biased toward circuital branches, but some still open for all departments. Personally, I got 4–5 shortlists from tech companies, but Vedanta was my first core shortlist. Students from our department often have to put in more effort, but consistent hard work does pay off. While core roles may be limited, this company stands out as it specifically considers candidates from MME. Even if you're not keen on a core role, I’d still recommend applying for this position—the work is not entirely core and is a solid opportunity. A CGPA above 7.5 helps with shortlisting, and having core-related projects or research internships definitely strengthens your profile."
    },
    {
      "question": "How important are PORs and internships for this role?",

If you’re targeting a company like Vedanta, definitely revise core metallurgy concepts and refer to interview questions from previous years."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did you specifically prepare for the interviews?",
      "answer": "I followed a multi-step approach: Reading blogs, Taking mock interviews, Talking to seniors Also, I focused on company-specific topics that are repeatedly asked in interviews. All of this gave me confidence and clarity during the actual process."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do departmental courses matter for this role?",
      "answer": "They matter a lot. Most of the interview questions were department-specific. For MME students, topics like metal extraction are especially important, and they were heavily emphasized in my interview."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you have any prior internships or projects before CDC? How did they help?",
      "answer": "Yes, I had: One research internship, One corporate internship, And a few self-initiated projects These experiences gave my CV practical depth, helping me get shortlists. Companies often discuss past work during interviews, so these internships definitely helped in demonstrating my abilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you think Dual Degree students have an advantage in core shortlisting?",
      "answer": "Generally, yes—especially for core roles. In our department, the shortlist ratio for Vedanta was about 70% Dual:30% B.Tech, and I was the only B.Tech student to receive an offer from the company."
    },
    {
      "question": "With just one month left before CDC, what should students focus on?",
      "answer": "With a month left, I suggest: Focus on impactful projects for your target profile, Practice DSA regularly, Go through previous interview/test questions, Prepare your CV early and get it reviewed by seniors. Also, stay in touch with seniors—they offer valuable guidance. And most importantly, don’t give up. CDC is a mix of skills and luck, and it doesn’t define your worth. Stay consistent, give your best in every opportunity, and stay positive—your effort will pay off."

      "question": "Did you face any challenges as an MME student in terms of CV shortlisting?",
      "answer": "Yes, many companies don’t open for metallurgy students. They often allow only circuital branches. But if you have the right skills, you can still apply to those open for us. Companies like Amazon, for example, did accept us. For consulting firms like BCG or McKinsey, CGPA becomes very important — usually above 8 or 8.5."
    },
    {
      "question": "When did you begin preparing, and what was your strategy?",
      "answer": "Preparation depends on the profile. For core roles, past coursework and projects help a lot. For consulting and data, I’d suggest beginning at least six months in advance. I initially aimed for consulting — got shortlisted by Kepler Cannon but missed the interview due to travel. Later, I shifted focus to core because of changing criteria and my background. Understanding company-specific work helps. For Vedanta, I studied aluminium production and metallurgy concepts like ductility vs strength — and how tempering can balance both."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did you prepare for the interview?",
      "answer": "I consulted seniors for common HR and technical questions. There’s a useful HR question bank of ~60 questions. For technical preparation, I revised extraction processes for iron, aluminium, zinc — especially topics relevant to Vedanta. Seniors helped me with mock interviews too."
    },
    {
      "question": "What preparation do you suggest during summer breaks?",
      "answer": "If not doing an internship, work under a department professor. Core-related projects, literature reviews, or even projects at IISc, DMRL, or DRDO are great. A decent CGPA (7.5+) is important. Reading research papers in your domain of interest and summarizing them for your CV also adds value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does a strong CV look like to you?",
      "answer": "A good CGPA (7.5+), and strong core-related projects — especially under reputed professors or institutes. For consulting, a high CGPA, achievements in Inter-IITs, or winning case study competitions matter. Relevant projects are critical for data roles."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should students approach off-campus internships?",
      "answer": "Cold emailing is key. Reach out to professors with a solid cover letter and resume. Look for openings on portals of IITs, IISc, DRDO, IOCL, etc. Many offer summer internships — stay alert. Express genuine interest in their research area."
    },
    {
      "question": "What was your backup plan?",
