      "content": "COMPOSIT 2025, the flagship materials science symposium of IIT Kharagpur, witnessed an unprecedented surge in participation this year—an outcome that, while celebratory in numbers, revealed the growing pains of success. Historically known for its high-impact guest lectures, engaging workshops, and cutting-edge competitions, the fest has steadily evolved into a national magnet for students, researchers, and industry professionals. However, the dramatic hike in footfall this year caught organizers off guard. Accommodation shortages, long queues, and overwhelmed event venues led to concerns about safety, logistics, and the overall experience of attendees. While the vibrant enthusiasm for materials science is certainly a victory for the community, this year's turnout also served as a wake-up call: great interest must be matched with even greater infrastructure. The organizing team's passion was palpable, but 2025's tragic overflow underscored the urgent need to scale up resources and rethink event management for future editions. COMPOSIT's growing popularity is undeniable—now it's time to ensure the festival's heart doesn't get lost in the crowd.",

            "answer": "Hello! I’m currently interning at Fidelity Investments as an AI Engineering Intern. My work involves designing intelligent systems that support decision-making through machine learning and data-driven techniques. I work on building interactive applications, analyzing behavioral data, and developing tools to evaluate and improve user performance. Besides that, I also contribute to backend development, data processing pipelines, and integrate AI models into end-user platforms."

            "question": "Could you walk us through your CDC experience and how the interviews went?",
            "answer": "The CDC process was quite intense and exhausting, but ultimately rewarding. I found out I was shortlisted the night before, around 9–10 PM, and had to report by 8:30 AM the next morning. About 54 candidates were initially shortlisted. My first round was around 12:30 PM, after which we had a lunch break. Around 3:30 PM, we were told that 11 candidates had cleared the first round. My second round was at 6 PM, and all second-round candidates also appeared for the HR round around 7:30 PM. Results were out by 8:30 PM, and 4 candidates were selected. The entire process spanned over 12 hours, testing both patience and stamina."

          {
            "question": "That sounds intense! Do you remember what kind of questions they asked?",
            "answer": "Definitely. The questions covered Python basics, key concepts from my CV, and several ML/DL concepts. Since I had a finance-related project on my resume, they asked me to build a basic financial model to predict stock movements using historical data. There was also a SQL question that I had to solve on a blackboard — it tested not just correctness, but clarity of explanation under pressure."
          },

            "question": "Did you face any difficulty being from the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering department?",
            "answer": "Department bias and CG-based shortlisting are real issues for non-CS branches like ours. I was fortunate to have strong, focused projects aligned with data roles, so shortlisting wasn’t a major issue for me. But I know it can be a roadblock for many, despite their skill levels."

            "question": "How much do positions of responsibility (PORs) and internships matter?",
            "answer": "PORs matter more for roles like consulting, where leadership and communication skills are key. But for tech and core profiles, what truly matters is the depth and impact of your experience, whether through internships, projects, or even well-done PORs. It’s not about the title — it’s about what you’ve done."
          },
          {
            "question": "When did you start preparing for CDC and how did you go about it?",
            "answer": " I began a few months prior, focusing mainly on DSA and programming. I also participated in the JPMorgan Quantitative Finance Mentorship program, which gave me exposure to core math, finance, and probability. Alongside that, I made sure to polish every skill and concept reflected on my CV."
          },
          {
            "question": "And what about interview preparation?",
            "answer": "I made notes for every single line on my CV — what I did, why I did it, and what impact it had. I also practiced mock interviews with seniors, which helped a lot with articulation and confidence. Having a well-structured self-introduction ready helped me set the right tone from the beginning and transition smoothly into technical discussions."

          ,{
            "question": "How much domain knowledge is necessary?",
            "answer": "It depends on the role. For data and technical roles, strong fundamentals in Python, SQL, ML, and Statistics are expected. If your resume includes domain-specific elements like finance, you should know the basics. But overall, what matters most is how well you understand and can explain your experiences."
          },
          {
            "question": "What about DSA and CS fundamentals?",
            "answer": "DSA is critical — most shortlisting tests rely on it. You should be confident in core topics like arrays, trees, graphs, and DP. As for CS fundamentals, OOPs is commonly asked, while DBMS, OS, and Networks help but aren't always necessary unless explicitly relevant."
          },
          {
            "question": "Could you share some preparation resources and how to use the summer effectively?",
            "answer": " For DSA, I used LeetCode, InterviewBit, and GeeksforGeeks. For SQL, StrataScratch and HackerRank are great. For ML and stats, I relied on Andrew Ng’s course, StatQuest, and projects using Kaggle datasets. The summer break is the perfect time to explore. Build projects, review past work, and strengthen weak areas. Avoid trying to learn everything — double down on your strengths and make them interview-ready."

          {
            "question": "What does a good CV look like in your opinion?",
            "answer": " A good CV tells a coherent story. It doesn’t have to be long — even a few well-executed and deeply understood projects can make it strong. Clarity, impact, and authenticity matter far more than volume."

            "question": "Any suggestions on reaching out for off-campus internships?",

            "question": "What was your backup plan?",
            "answer": "My primary interest was AI and Data, so my backups were Data Analyst or Product Analyst roles, which require more problem-solving than heavy coding. I was also comfortable pivoting to Quant roles due to my finance-related work."

            "question": "With just a month left before placements, how should students approach their prep?",
            "answer": " Focus on strengthening what you already know — don’t try to learn completely new topics now. Have a few target companies in mind, study their past patterns, and tailor your prep accordingly. Some are DSA-heavy, others emphasize SQL or ML. That focused preparation helps you stay motivated."
