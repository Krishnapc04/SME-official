      "content": "COMPOSIT 2025, the flagship materials science symposium of IIT Kharagpur, witnessed an unprecedented surge in participation this year—an outcome that, while celebratory in numbers, revealed the growing pains of success. Historically known for its high-impact guest lectures, engaging workshops, and cutting-edge competitions, the fest has steadily evolved into a national magnet for students, researchers, and industry professionals. However, the dramatic hike in footfall this year caught organizers off guard. Accommodation shortages, long queues, and overwhelmed event venues led to concerns about safety, logistics, and the overall experience of attendees. While the vibrant enthusiasm for materials science is certainly a victory for the community, this year's turnout also served as a wake-up call: great interest must be matched with even greater infrastructure. The organizing team's passion was palpable, but 2025's tragic overflow underscored the urgent need to scale up resources and rethink event management for future editions. COMPOSIT's growing popularity is undeniable—now it's time to ensure the festival's heart doesn't get lost in the crowd.",

            "answer": "The CDC process was quite intense and exhausting, but ultimately rewarding. I found out I was shortlisted the night before, around 9–10 PM, and had to report by 8:30 AM the next morning. About 54 candidates were initially shortlisted. My first round was around 12:30 PM, after which we had a lunch break. Around 3:30 PM, we were told that 11 candidates had cleared the first round. My second round was at 6 PM, and all second-round candidates also appeared for the HR round around 7:30 PM. Results were out by 8:30 PM, and 4 candidates were selected. The entire process spanned over 12 hours, testing both patience and stamina."

          {
            "question": "That sounds intense! Do you remember what kind of questions they asked?",
            "answer": "Definitely. The questions covered Python basics, key concepts from my CV, and several ML/DL concepts. Since I had a finance-related project on my resume, they asked me to build a basic financial model to predict stock movements using historical data. There was also a SQL question that I had to solve on a blackboard — it tested not just correctness, but clarity of explanation under pressure."

But for tech and core profiles, what truly matters is the depth and impact of your experience, whether through internships, projects, or even well-done PORs. It’s not about the title — it’s about what you’ve done."

I also practiced mock interviews with seniors, which helped a lot with articulation and confidence. Having a well-structured self-introduction ready helped me set the right tone from the beginning and transition smoothly into technical discussions."

          ,{
            "question": "How much domain knowledge is necessary?",
            "answer": "It depends on the role. For data and technical roles, strong fundamentals in Python, SQL, ML, and Statistics are expected. If your resume includes domain-specific elements like finance, you should know the basics. But overall, what matters most is how well you understand and can explain your experiences."

            "question": "What about DSA and CS fundamentals?",
            "answer": "DSA is critical — most shortlisting tests rely on it. You should be confident in core topics like arrays, trees, graphs, and DP. As for CS fundamentals, OOPs is commonly asked, while DBMS, OS, and Networks help but aren't always necessary unless explicitly relevant."

          {
            "question": "Could you share some preparation resources and how to use the summer effectively?",
            "answer": " For DSA, I used LeetCode, InterviewBit, and GeeksforGeeks. For SQL, StrataScratch and HackerRank are great. For ML and stats, I relied on Andrew Ng’s course, StatQuest, and projects using Kaggle datasets. The summer break is the perfect time to explore. Build projects, review past work, and strengthen weak areas. Avoid trying to learn everything — double down on your strengths and make them interview-ready."

    {
      "question": "How was your overall CDC experience?",
      "answer": "I got shortlisted for three companies. I wasn’t selected in the first two, but got into Honeywell. The process had one OA with 4 questions — 3 DSA problems and one Python-based string problem. After clearing that, there was one technical interview focused on my CV. It was panel-based and had in-depth questions about my projects and internships."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you remember any specific questions from your interviews?",
      "answer": "Yes, the interviewer asked me to explain each project in detail, especially my deep learning projects. I was asked about ML models, evaluation metrics, and specific methods mentioned in my resume. The interview was 20–25 minutes long."
    },
    {
      "question": "What challenges did you face as an MME student during CDC?",
      "answer": "Some companies prefer circuital branches, and many have a CGPA cutoff (above 8.0 is safe). Internships and strong CVs help more than PORs in data roles. MME students have to work harder to get shortlists, but interviews depend on individual performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you have any prior internships? If yes, how did they help? How can one approach the same?",
      "answer": "Yes, I had two research internships. They added value to my CV. Cold-mailing to professors and exploring FTP or projects at IIT KGP are good ways to get internships."
    },
    {
      "question": "When did you begin preparing for CDC? What was your overall preparation strategy?",
      "answer": "I started profile building after 2nd year and serious CDC prep in the 6th semester. Focused on Python, ML, and stats. Took MLFA, got research internships, did Leetcode, brushed up SQL, and joined tech competitions like TechGC and OpenIIT."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did you specifically prepare for interviews?",
      "answer": "Focused on knowing my CV thoroughly. Revised projects, stats, and did mock interviews with friends. Prepared short project stories. Also spoke to seniors who interned at Honeywell."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could you share some preparation resources or tips for juniors? How should one start their prep? How to make the most of the summer break?",
      "answer": "Start with Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, then ML and stats. Use CampusX, Krish Naik, CodeEmporium, StatQuest, 3Blue1Brown. Do DSA and get a research internship or build projects during summer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What, in your opinion, makes a strong CV?",
      "answer": "Unique and impactful projects, real-world use cases, results-driven points with numbers. Avoid generic projects. Be confident about everything on your CV. Achievements and competitions help."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did you have a backup profile or alternative plan?",
      "answer": "Yes, I had three CVs — two for data roles (one tailored for FinTech) and one for core. It’s good to be prepared with backups, especially for non-circuit branches."
    },
    {
      "question": "With only a month left before CDC, what should students focus on?",
      "answer": "Focus on OA prep and CV prep. Practice DSA (Striver’s Sheet, Leetcode Medium), revise aptitude and puzzles, ML/DL/stats concepts, and be confident about your projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "Any final tips or advice you’d like to share?",
      "answer": "Rejections and delays are normal — don’t panic. Keep preparing and stay confident. I got my offer in mid-September. Trust the process. You’ll get through — and even if not, it’s not the end. All the best!"
